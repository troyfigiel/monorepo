#+title: Reproducibility in software

For example, a Dockerfile does not make the building process reproducible. If you run ~apt-get install <library>~ inside your container, you will run into the exact same problems from the perspective of reproducibility due to the lack of a locking mechanism / guarantee of installing the exact same software upon every build.
