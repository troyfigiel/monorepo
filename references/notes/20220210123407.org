#+title: Mean

There are many different notions of mean. The most common notion is the [[id:de880bd6-4759-41c6-84d5-9baeccd85fb1][Arithmetic mean]] which for a set of numbers \( x_1, ..., x_n \) is defined as

\[ \bar{x}_{\mathrm{AM}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \]

Two other well-known notions of mean are the [[id:2ba59e71-71d2-45ed-b543-dd701757bde0][Geometric mean]] and the [[id:0a8c9c6d-3089-4f1f-86c0-8c05e298172e][Harmonic mean]] defined as

\[ \bar{x}_{\mathrm{GM}} = \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \right)^{1 / n} \]
\[ \bar{x}_{\mathrm{HM}} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 1 / x_i} \]

All these notions of means can be combined into a single [[id:3d83ef63-d2fa-48d7-8e71-4e483c8e5c7e][Generalized mean]].
