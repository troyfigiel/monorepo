#+title: Congruent system
#+filetags: :stub:

A congruent system is a system in which the reality of the state on disk evolves in the same way as
the expectation of administrators. Keeping a system congruent can be done using tools like [[id:f7ad75d2-cb09-4a82-b556-2eca7cbe950f][Puppet]]
and [[id:2b8ee7a6-a7d8-4e6d-8244-c441c8e98780][Chef]].

Note though that [[id:837b8f7d-221e-440e-80c1-ff96bd095f7c][Ansible]] does not work with a daemon, so there is no guarantee of a congruent
system after [[id:364c4a7f-6a3f-4d80-92cb-a8ca5b8409bf][Configuration drift]] has been addressed.
