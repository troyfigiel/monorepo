Reproducibility can refer both to experimental reproducibility as well as reproducibility of
software. The degree of reproducibility can differ here: For an experiment we might be satisfied if
the results are similar enough, but when it comes to software we often mean a completely
reproducible program or workflow. See: [[id:b23d8dfc-cb57-4154-aab9-88d1d17bd8c9][Reproducible build]].
