#+title: Closures and objects are equivalent
#+filetags: :stub:

Closures and objects can be considered as the same kind of construction but in different paradigms.
Closures are more common in [[id:adb76ca1-2503-491a-b0f4-be4f91536659][Functional programming]] and at the very least require the notion of
[[id:0f8f1193-72fb-488b-a2e5-1fa48a2a4309][First-class functions]]. Objects on the other hand appear in [[id:7afe5e88-5645-4674-b305-bd71262b6b7e][Object-oriented programming]].

The unidirectional implications of this equivalence are often states as:
- Closures are a poor man's object
- Objects are a poor man's closure

# TODO: Show that closures and objects are really equivalent.
