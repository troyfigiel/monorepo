A [[id:5e655eb0-b08b-432d-b990-415c625ad3f5][Programming language]] is called homoiconic if a program written in that language, can be
manipulated as if it were data by that same language. In other words, there exists a [[id:bcdf9967-fca4-435e-b425-f876b816b575][Duality
between code and data]].

A famous example of homoiconic languages are the [[id:c13150c6-8c19-4bc5-ae6e-d1deb78fcc32][Lisp]] languages. However, also [[id:1b0f0cbf-5ed8-4e1b-85f7-09b011c293fb][Julia]] is considered
to be a homoiconic language.
