#+title: Zero-inflated model
#+filetags: :stub:

A zero-inflated model is a statistical model based on a distribution that allows for frequent
zero-valued observations.

[[id:3ec7855e-14b6-4f4b-962e-fa14b35f5a04][Zero-inflated models are mixture models]].

Zero-inflated models are similar to [[id:afa0ca2d-89fd-4a83-b350-2f6c82cb2b50][Hurdle models]] but not the same.
