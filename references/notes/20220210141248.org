#+title: law of rare events

The law of rare events is also known as the Poisson limit theorem.

This theorem states that for a sequence \( n p_n \) satisfying \( \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n p_n = \lambda \), the following holds:

\[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \binom{n}{k} p_n^k (1 - p_n)^{n - k} = \frac{\lambda^k e^{- \lambda}}{k!} \]

In other words, if we have a large number of independent events that all have a small probability of happening, we may approximate this behaviour with a Poisson distribution.

Hence, we find the [[id:f3c34da4-ceb1-4fe0-8bc0-37f47f5c5821][Limiting distribution]]

\[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathrm{B}(n, p_n) = \mathrm{Pois}(\lambda) \]
