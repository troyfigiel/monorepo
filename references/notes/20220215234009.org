#+title: Non-parametric skew

The nonparametric skew of a probability distribution is defined as the quotient \( (\mu - \nu) / \sigma \) with \( \mu \) the mean, \( \nu \) the median and \( \sigma \) the standard deviation of the probability distribution.

This definition of skew has some desirable properties:
- The [[id:348ffc2e-4800-49da-9ea2-2c1b0bb7d0dc][Non-parametric skew vanishes for symmetric distribution]].

The absolute value of the nonparametric skew is bounded from above by 1, because for any
distribution [[id:c04f4ab1-ee2c-446b-9e63-75270da64bcd][?The mean lies within a standard deviation from the median]].

# TODO: Add some more desirable properties of the non-parametric skew.
