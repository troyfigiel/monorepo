#+title: Bathtub curve
#+filetags: :stub:

The bathtub curve is a widely used model to describe the [[id:fc020c1e-4677-4310-9775-492fcdf9b0f1][Failure rate]] of products. It consists of
three phases:
1. Initially the failure rate decreases due to early failures.
2. At some point the failure rate is dominated by random failures and is approximately constant.
3. In the final phase, the failure rate starts increasing due to wear-out failures.
