#+title: Scrum methodology
#+filetags: :stub:

The Scrum methodology is a methodology for building software. It is a particular implementation of [[id:3e5572d5-7cd4-4ebc-843e-f531ddc819d2][Agile development]].

* Process

Unlike the [[id:98c275fa-524f-4bbf-83fd-63e3fd9c9649][Waterfall methodology]], in Scrum the entire process is broken up into smaller pieces:
First the bare minimum amount of planning is done to get started, which developers then build into a minimal feature set.
# TODO: Is this the same as an [[id:a44237ec-1770-4f35-8968-854644d6ca8e][Minimal viable product]]?
After the build phase, testing and review of that small set of features is done.

Such an incremental release takes place in a time span of approximately one to three weeks and is called a [[id:0fc2466c-df40-4b26-8eb1-67dcf858f465][Sprint]].
After each [[id:0fc2466c-df40-4b26-8eb1-67dcf858f465][Sprint]] we have a [[id:0467dcbd-0cab-4483-b6d4-f7f22e4091df][Potentially shippable product]] and this process is repeated until the product is [[id:dbb16562-e671-4ddd-ae44-052f2b5da1a5][Feature complete]].

* Roles

Scrum has three key roles for the methodology to succeed:
- [[id:7027bb9d-cacb-49b4-ba35-ccd38058e548][Product owner]]
- [[id:f57fd375-53ba-445b-b505-55e7568889dd][Scrum master]]
- [[id:5ea5a00b-0cf2-44fd-a574-dc8cb4662d1e][Scrum team]]

* Tools

Scrum uses three different tools for the process:
- [[id:4cbd3611-9c56-492c-b3f8-e0f4d54d0b3f][Product backlog]]
- [[id:2b4cdf9e-e3fc-443c-9013-de7b5173ef98][Sprint backlog]]
- [[id:9385c473-2ccd-4b2c-adf8-0553f1d66ab3][Burndown chart]]

* Meetings

Scrum has three types of meetings:
- [[id:63e77336-9996-4bd6-a99d-e8a37227194f][Sprint planning]]
- [[id:b43fad25-558b-4692-af4e-38f567f5ff4a][Daily Scrum]]
- [[id:6b3fb7f5-285d-4485-8199-9127db76e164][Sprint review]]
