#+title: The equipartition theorem is a purely classical result
#+filetags: :stub:

Some degrees of freedom can only be activated when the difference between energy levels if of the
order of \( k_B T \).

The equipartition theorem only applies to the degrees of freedom that are activated (as can be seen
from quantum mechanics). Translational degrees of freedom are always activated, but vibrational
degrees of freedom only for temperatures higher than \( k_B T \sim \hbar \omega \).
