#+title: Normalization should be done only on the training set
#+filetags: :stub:

If we build an algorithm that needs to normalize the data, we have to "fit" the normalization on
the training set. Then we apply both the trained normalization as well as the trained model
directly on the test set.

If we were to normalize the test data with its own parameters, we would be encoding information of
the test data into the model. However, the goal for the test data is to check how well the model
performs on individual observations that we feed into the model. When we are predicting a single
value, we have to use the normalization parameters of the train set and do not have access to a
test set.
