#+title: Markov chain
#+filetags: :unclean:

A Markov chain is a stochastic model where the probability of an event occurring only depends on the current state.

Finite-dimensional Markov chains can be described through finite-dimensional [[id:e7bf4db5-402c-405e-a03d-be68a143ee91][Representation theory]]
using a [[id:f87cfbed-01da-4bcc-b89f-6a7510e0f213][Stochastic matrix]].

Markov chains satisfy a form of memorylessness, often called the [[id:34e88da2-9935-4d9e-9cc1-a873e86de7fa][Markov property]].

We can broadly classify Markov chains in four classes based on whether time is discrete or
continuous and based on whether the state space is countable or continuous.

Markov chains often have a [[id:7fb9079c-7485-4a0e-a1a7-dea306afa992][Steady state distribution]], but not always. This can happen for [[id:e00e1ae4-d048-468f-9b2f-e88b6c9caa31][Periodic Markov chains]] for example.

Another class of Markov chains are [[id:25f8ccb7-2c86-46d1-bef3-c3650dd3c567][Terminating Markov chain]].

Markov chains appear in many different fields such as

- [[id:88c2bef4-3272-46ac-96a5-fe138e9f4ade][Population dynamics]]

- [[id:dcf532f4-7c3d-4997-9391-8ae3613bcb12][Natural language processing]]
