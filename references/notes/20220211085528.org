#+title: Loss function

If we can express a problem in terms of the minimization of a certain number, we call this number the loss and the function that maps an event to this number the loss function.

Two very common loss functions are
- [[id:ab6e7a3e-f42e-42ac-bd4d-a5ad56a9562d][Quadratic loss function]]
- [[id:33b4ed57-781f-4d35-9f29-99023794cded][0-1 loss function]]

The expected value of the loss function is known as the [[id:108a427d-6e46-42f1-ba5f-838c482ccf4b][risk function]].

A loss function should not be conflated with an evaluation metric. See [[id:8f6c6d03-a97d-4acf-bbd4-42ea2de19043][Loss function versus evaluation metric]].
