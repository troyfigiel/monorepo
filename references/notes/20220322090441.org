#+title: Asymptotic series of integrals
#+filetags: :stub:

Asymptotic series of integrals appear very often when we solve [[id:54330b73-a6ad-4a27-b1c6-fa9e51c8b3b9][Differential equations]] using
techniques like the [[id:e74cd422-0192-4377-9a1c-d957660764f0][Laplace transformation]] or the [[id:f8bb0f89-e50b-46f7-898b-40d02b818fc9][Fourier transformation]].

Asymptotics will be able to tell us the long-time or the far-field behaviour of these integrals
when we cannot solve them in closed form, allowing us to still extract interesting behaviour of the
solutions.

For a list of examples, see [[id:7fa3925a-0e4c-4bf8-9478-53a90ba6388a][!Asymptotic series of integrals]].

There are several well-known [[id:7dbdf69f-0506-423d-9c8d-015177b2591e][!Techniques for constructing asymptotic series of integrals]].
