#+title: Imbalanced data
#+filetags: :stub:

"One of the most annoying and most difficult problems in ML."

Normally, a misclassified positive counts the same as a misclassified negative. If we weigh
positive counts differently from negative counts in the [[id:383c7fe8-a362-46fd-a179-6f9a608e974f][Loss function]], we can off-set the effect of
imbalanced data.

Always look at the [[id:364c4a7f-6a3f-4d80-92cb-a8ca5b8409bf][Configuration drift]] to check the [[id:47d76987-8935-4cde-8933-c006a7f2bb8b][False positive rate]] and the [[id:04b7ba8e-ecb5-40d0-b910-6fed81078f73][False negative rate]].
