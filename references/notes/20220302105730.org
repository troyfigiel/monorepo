#+title: Multicollinearity
#+filetags: :stub:

Multicollinearity is a phenomenon where some variables in a set of [[id:883ce7c1-a74e-4993-9f9d-78674d99411b][Independent variables]] can be
linearly predicted from each other with a high degree of accuracy. If there is an exact linear
dependence between the variables, we call this [[id:fb2db520-735d-4d5b-a6ae-7e55fd8a289e][Perfect multicollinearity]].

This can cause several isses:
- [[id:98699707-c0b9-4f56-8385-768648bfcd96][Linear regression coefficients change erratically upon slight data perturbations]]
- [[id:4dae0284-260a-4548-bb67-2d2524f4e9e2][Linear regression coefficients may be significant together but not individually]]

Care should be taken when it comes to checking for collinearity, because [[id:be4ea42d-778f-4820-948b-f38563d53110][High multicollinearity can not always be observed from pairwise correlation]]

However, [[id:abbead16-022a-4063-b8b1-352f20b9ebf5][Multicollinearity does not bias results]].

# TODO: Is there a link to Confounders?
# They both lead to poorly generalizable models but both do not affect in-sample predictions
