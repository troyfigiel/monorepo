# TODO: Give some examples of non-negative probability distributions
# Gamma (exponential, chi-squared), log-normal, geometric, Poisson, ...?

# TODO: Probability distributions that square to well-known non-negative distribution?
# For example, normal and chi-squared?

# TODO: Make relation to Markov's inequality clear. What are the implications?

A non-negative probability distribution is a one-dimensional probability distribution of a random
variable that cannot be negative.

There are many such distributions, because one can always square a generic probability distribution
to obtain a non-negative probability distribution.
