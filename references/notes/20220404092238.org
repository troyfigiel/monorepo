Can be used to prove how many positive or non-negative integers tuples exist whose sum is equal to
a specified number.

For example, \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10 \) and we are looking at non-negative integers, then
there are

\[
\binom{10+4-1}{4-1} = 286
\]

arrangements.

For only positive integers, we have only

\[
\binom{10-1}{4-1} = 84
\]

arrangements.
