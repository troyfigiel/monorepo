You have arrived at the landing page of my notes. You can move around these notes by clicking on
the links.

At the moment I am mainly using [[id:d1968552-6a83-4e46-9fe3-76048108bc1e][Note taking as a tool for learning]] and as an experiment to see how
I could go about [[id:2094556f-2aa8-4f50-a84e-0f88e8233234][Maintaining an increasingly complex system of notes]]. In the future, this will form
the backbone for writing material.

To get started, you can have look at the canonical starting point [[id:ca7060f7-53dc-46a6-9e46-e1d0c1343158][§Index]]. From there you can browse
from note to note by clicking on the links. [[id:8b2907c7-0fb7-496f-abc2-9f6d4ff6bc8a][§In progress]] keeps track of the bigger topics I am
currently working on, although I also tend to add shorter notes here and there.

# TODO: Put this in the right context
[[id:3069e3e6-4c91-4498-9874-3f6c63e670c5][What I would tell myself just starting out with this system of notes]].
