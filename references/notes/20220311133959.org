#+title: Loss function versus evaluation metric
#+filetags: :stub:

The [[id:383c7fe8-a362-46fd-a179-6f9a608e974f][Loss function]] is what a machine learning model will minimize during the training phase whereas
an [[id:6bfd92ec-d6f9-4e34-901e-1ab86962d0b8][Evaluation metric]] gives you a better, more intuitive understanding of the performance of your
model.

When we are doing [[id:432ba18c-4398-4a70-a250-a2f63235308e][Gradient descent]], differentiability of the loss function will make optimization
much easier whereas many evaluation metrics might not be differentiable at all.
