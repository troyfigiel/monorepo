#+title: Data as code
#+filetags: :stub:

When we work with [[id:905dbef6-3b19-4b5e-978a-b4f1560b6a9a][Infrastructure as code]] and [[id:9a6525a6-f10a-4064-a3a8-b6bfad9c8093][Configuration as code]], we are explicitly treating the
infrastructure and configuration data as code for an interpreter. The interpreter will make sure
that the infrastructure or configuration we specify, will be created.
