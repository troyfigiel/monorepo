#+title: Pip

Although pip can be used to install Python packages, it does not automatically check for transitive
dependencies nor writes a lock-file by default.

Using hashes and locking transitive dependencies becomes very unwieldy using pip. It is possible to
use `pip freeze`, but the downside of this, is that all of the requirements are written to the same file
and it becomes incredibly hard to figure out which package you need pulled in a specific
requirement. This is especially difficult if you need to remove a package and all of its dependencies.

Therefore, tools like [[id:9cb87e93-a28c-47ad-8183-7c6af52fa3f2][Pip-tools]] and [[id:39c8a80c-6de6-4232-9165-ed3a4864440f][Poetry]] aim to make installing Python packages easier and reproducible.
