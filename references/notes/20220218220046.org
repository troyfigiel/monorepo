#+title: law of averages

A particular outcome or event will over a certain period of time occur at a frequency that is similar to its probability.

This idea can lead to the [[id:e5840612-6843-450f-9e05-2f0f09d6aef2][gambler's fallacy]] if one believes that independent events are dependent on the previous results since a certain event has not happened in a while.
