#+title: An operating system is the result of a function
#+filetags: :stub:

This function takes the configuration and the package tree and builds an operating system. This is
used for [[denote:20220221T224049][Declarative operating system configuration]].

When global state is involved though, this function is not a [[denote:20220303T125546][Pure function]] (see [[denote:20220309T180541][Global state is evil]]).
