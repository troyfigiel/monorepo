The binomial distribution \( \mathrm{B}(n, p) \) describes the probability distribution for the number of successes for \( n \) independent experiments all having a probability \( p \) of succeeding.

If we let \( n \) grow such that \( n p \) approaches the limit \( \lambda \), the [[denote:20220210T141248][law of rare events]] states we recover the Poisson distribution \( \mathrm{Pois}(\lambda) \).

When \( n \) increases, the [[denote:20220210T205321][normal approximation of the binomial]] states that \( \mathcal{N}(np, np(1-p)) \) becomes a reasonable approximation to \( \mathrm{B}(n, p) \).

Proving that the probability mass function of the binomial distribution sums to one, requires a
special case of the [[denote:20220223T205208][Binomial formula]].
