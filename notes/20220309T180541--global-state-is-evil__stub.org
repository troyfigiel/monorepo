#+title: Global state is evil
#+filetags: :stub:

- Anything can change it, so you can never be completely sure it will behave as expected, unless
  you know everything about what can possibly change the state.
- If you have to change global state, it will have to be changed everywhere it is used. There is no
  [[denote:20220315T123050][Encapsulation]] and no API used to access the state.
- With global state, many [[denote:20220303T125546][Pure functions]] become impure. This means it becomes hard for the compiler
  to optimize these functions.
