The Laplace-de Rham operator is a second-order differential operator which acts on sections of the bundle of differential forms. It is defined in terms of the exterior derivative \( d \) and the codifferential \( \delta \) by

\[ \Delta = d \delta + \delta d = (d + \delta)^2 \]

The second equality follows from the fact that \( d^2 = \delta^2 = 0 \).
