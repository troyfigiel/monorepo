Used in many fields of [[denote:20220310T200725][Physics]] and [[denote:20220310T200757][Mathematics]]. It is derived from [[denote:20220310T200833][The principle of least action]].
It leads to [[denote:20220324T213901][Lagrangian mechanics]] as a reformulation of [[denote:20220324T213920][Classical mechanics]].
