- [[denote:20220221T233800][Emacs]]

Text editors like Vim and Emacs will always be around when we need to do administration from the
command line and we need to quickly pop in and out of files, for example when a desktop environment
broke or if we are changing configurations through [[denote:20220316T133518][SSH]].
