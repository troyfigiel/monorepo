#+title: False discovery rate
#+filetags: :stub:

The false discovery rate (FDR) is a conceptualization of the false positive rate when conducting
[[denote:20220221T214048][multiple comparisons]].

These procedures have less strict control over false positives compared to [[denote:20220221T213948][familywise error rate]]
controlling procedures.

One example of a method is the [[denote:20220221T214303][Benjamini-Hochberg method]].
