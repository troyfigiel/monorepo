#+title: Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem
#+filetags: :stub:

This theorem states that the maximum of a sample will follow a distribution of one of these three
forms:
- [[denote:20220320T143640][Gumbel distribution]]
- [[denote:20220320T143652][Fr√©chet distribution]]
- [[denote:20220302T235424][Weibull distribution]]

These three distributions are combined in the [[denote:20220320T144032][Generalized extreme value distribution]].
