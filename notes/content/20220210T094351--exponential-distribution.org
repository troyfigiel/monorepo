The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution with support over the positive real numbers.

It is defined by the probability density function

\[ f(x) = \lambda e^{- \lambda x} \]

where \( \lambda > 0 \) is known as the rate parameter.

It has mean \( \mathbb{E}[X] = 1 / \lambda \) and variance \( \mathrm{Var}[X] = 1 / \lambda^2 \).

It can be uniquely specified by the fact that it is [[denote:20220210T123606][Memoryless]] or equivalenty that it has a
constant [[denote:20220227T162750][Hazard rate]].
