#+title: Vandermonde's identity
#+filetags: :stub:

Vandermonde's identity states that

\[
\binom{m+n}{r} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^r \binom{m}{k} \binom{n}{r-k}
\]

for non-negative integers \( r, m, n \).

This identity is used to prove that [[denote:20220306T174301][?The PMF of the hypergeometric distribution sums to one]].
