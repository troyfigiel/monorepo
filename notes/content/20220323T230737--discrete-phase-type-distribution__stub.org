#+title: Discrete phase-type distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

The discrete phase-type distribution models the time until absorption for a [[denote:20220323T230039][Terminating Markov
chain]].

If we describe this Markov chain by the [[denote:20220323T225426][Stochastic matrix]]

\begin{equation*}
P =
\begin{pmatrix}
T & \mathbf{T}^0 \\
\mathbf{0}^{\intercal} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

and the initial probability distribution over the states (also called phases) by a vector \( \boldsymbol{\tau} \) (assuming no
probability is at the absorbing state), the discrete phase-type distribution is denoted by \(
\mathrm{DHP}(\boldsymbol{\tau}, T) \) and has cumulative distribution function

\[
F(k) = 1 - \boldsymbol{\tau} T^k \mathbf{1}
\]

The density function is given by

\[
f(k) = \boldsymbol{\tau} T^{k-1} \mathbf{T}^0
\]

and can be shown to sum to 1 through the relation \( \mathbf{T}^0 + T \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{1} \):

\[
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \boldsymbol{\tau} T^{k-1} \mathrm{T}^0 + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}
\boldsymbol{\tau} T^k \mathbf{1} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \boldsymbol{\tau} T^{k-1} \mathbf{1}
\]

But now

\[
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \boldsymbol{\tau} T^{k-1} \mathbf{1} = \boldsymbol{\tau} \mathbf{1} +
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \boldsymbol{\tau} T^k \mathbf{1}
\]

Finally noting that \( \boldsymbol{\tau} \) is a probability distribution over all states, we must
have \( \boldsymbol{\tau} \mathbf{1} = 1 \), proving the result.

Note that the discrete-phase type distribution generalizes many discrete distributions:
- [[denote:20220323T232600][The geometric distribution is a discrete phase-type distribution with a single state]]
- [[denote:20220323T232625][The negative binomial distribution is a discrete phase-type distribution with multiple identical states]]
