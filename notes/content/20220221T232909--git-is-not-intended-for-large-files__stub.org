#+title: Git is not intended for large files
#+filetags: :stub:

For larger files, Git stores the entire history and every change to the file as a new file. This is
due to its contant-addressable nature.

Instead, in these cases other tools like [[denote:20220221T232959][Git LFS]] or [[denote:20220221T233008][dvc]] can be used.
