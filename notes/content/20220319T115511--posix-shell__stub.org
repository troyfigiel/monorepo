#+title: POSIX shell
#+filetags: :stub:

The two main strengths of the POSIX shell are
- Piping commands
- External command execution as a [[denote:20220319T115600][First-class citizen]]

- [[denote:20220319T115627][Dash]]

Close to, but not completely POSIX-compliant:
- [[denote:20220220T094827][Bash]]
- [[denote:20220319T115706][Zsh]]

Other shells:
- [[denote:20220319T115649][Fish]]
