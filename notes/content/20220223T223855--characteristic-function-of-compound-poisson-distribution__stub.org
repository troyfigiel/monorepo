#+title: characteristic function of compound Poisson distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

* Formal statement
Let \( Y \) follow a compound Poisson distribution with respect to the random variable \( X \).

By definition of the characteristic function, \( \varphi_{Y}(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{itY}] \).

Now by the [[denote:20220223T223732][law of total expectation]] ..

* TODO
Finish
