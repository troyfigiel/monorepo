#+title: Factorial moment generating function
#+filetags: :stub:

The factorial moment generating function of a distribution is defined as \( M_X(t) =
\mathbb{E}[t^X] \).

Since [[denote:20220224T220317][Every probability distribution has a characteristic function]], we know that the moment
generating function is defined at least for \( |t| = 1 \).

For various calculations of generating functions, see: [[denote:20220303T231816][?Factorial moment generating function]].
