#+title: Loss function

If we can express a problem in terms of the minimization of a certain number, we call this number the loss and the function that maps an event to this number the loss function.

Two very common loss functions are
- [[denote:20220211T090016][Quadratic loss function]]
- [[denote:20220211T090044][0-1 loss function]]

The expected value of the loss function is known as the [[denote:20220211T085432][risk function]].

A loss function should not be conflated with an evaluation metric. See [[denote:20220311T133959][Loss function versus evaluation metric]].
