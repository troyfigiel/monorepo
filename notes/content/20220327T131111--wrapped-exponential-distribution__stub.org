#+title: Wrapped exponential distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

The wrapped exponential distribution is the [[denote:20220327T123142][Wrapped distribution]] obtained by wrapping the
[[denote:20220210T094351][Exponential distribution]].

It turns out that this is identical to the [[denote:20220304T135045][Truncated distribution]] of the [[denote:20220210T094351][Exponential distribution]]
to the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2 \pi \).
