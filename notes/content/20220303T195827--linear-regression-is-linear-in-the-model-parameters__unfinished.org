This can easily be a point of confusion: The linearity of a [[denote:20220215T221824][Linear regression]] model refers to
the dependence of the dependent variable on the parameters of the model.

As the most basic example, [[denote:20220303T200225][Polynomial regression]] is in fact a subset of [[denote:20220215T221824][Linear regression]].

# TODO: Refer to kernel methods, because linear least squares is actually a very broad way of
# fitting data.
