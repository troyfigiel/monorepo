When you use a [[denote:20220303T134750][Black box model]] and explain it afterwards.
Start with a black box, then:
- Create another model that approximates it
- Compute derivatives of it
- Visualize what part of the input the model is paying attention to

This is in contrast to [[denote:20220303T134927][Interpretable machine learning]].
