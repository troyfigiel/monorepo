#+title: Batch layer
#+filetags: :stub:

The batch layer is a part of the [[denote:20221028T145644][Lambda architecture]].

When we are receiving new data from [[denote:20221028T150050][Data stream]], the batch layer records it in a [[denote:20221028T151932][Master dataset]].
Once we have enough data, we retrain, build and test any downstream [[denote:20221028T152143][Machine learning models]].
The new model is then deployed in the [[denote:20221028T151552][Speed layer]].
