[[denote:20220322T105321][Renormalization]] subsumes many methods in perturbation theory. In dynamical systems it also goes by
the name of the envelope method which was independently discovered.

It uses the [[denote:20220322T105540][Envelope equation]] to construct a solution out of an envelope of perturbative solutions.

It was shown by Kunihiro that these methods actually coincide and that the [[denote:20220322T105832][Renormalization group
equations]] follow from the envelope equation.
