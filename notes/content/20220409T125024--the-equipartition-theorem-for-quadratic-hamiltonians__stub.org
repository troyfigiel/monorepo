[[denote:20220409T133544][Quadratic form]]

If a degree of freedom \( x_n \) appears quadratically, such as for a classical freely moving
particle, rotational kinetic energy or potential energy in a [[denote:20220408T210557][Harmonic oscillator]]. In that case,
each degree of freedom contributes a total of \( k_B T / 2 \) to the total energy. In particular,
the total energy is independent of the precise microscopic values of any coefficients appearing in
the [[denote:20220324T213756][Hamiltonian]]!

In fact, if we are dealing with a real quadratic form,

\[
H = x^{\intercal} A x = x^{\intercal} S^{\intercal} D S x
\]

where \( D \) is diagonal. In this case, we have

\[
H(y_1, ..., y_n) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n d_i y_i^2
\]

where \( y = Sx \). This means that we can apply the equipartition theorem for each term \( d_i
y_i^2 \), showing that every independent degree of freedom \( y_i \) adds a total of \( k_B T / 2
\) of energy to the total average energy.

However, [[denote:20220409T125147][In general the equipartition theorem depends on microscopic parameters]].
