#+title: ordinary least squares

Ordinary least squares is a linear regression model \( y_i = \mathbf{x}_i^{\intercal} \mathbf{\beta}+ \epsilon_i \) where we aim to optimize the loss function

\[
S(\beta) = \left\Vert \mathbf{y} - \mathrm{X} \mathbf{\beta} \right\Vert
\]

It is well-known that [[denote:20220218T202913][OLS optimization is convex]]. When \( X \) is full-rank, it is even strictly convex implying that the [[denote:20220218T201759][OLS optimization has a unique solution]].

Additionally, [[denote:20220218T202249][The OLS estimator is the maximum likelihood estimate for normally distributed errors]].

Goodness-of-fit is commonly measured with the [[denote:20220218T202620][coefficient of determination]] denoted by \( R^2 \).
