#+filetags: :stub:

The point mass distribution is a [[denote:20220303T223003][Discrete probability distribution]] where all the probability mass
is concentrated at a single point. In other words, if \( X \sim \delta_a \) then \( \mathbb{P}(X = a) = 1 \).

[[denote:20220303T220832][The point mass distribution is the only distribution with vanishing standard deviation]].
