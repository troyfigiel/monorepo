#+title: Training a model means to learn a function
#+filetags: :stub:

When we train a model, we are doing nothing more and nothing less than building (a possibly highly
complicated) function which takes data of a pre-determined form and and gives back a
prediction. This implies that after training, the function should be considered as fixed until
retraining happens.

This has several subtle, but very important implications. For example
- [[denote:20220304T182013][Normalization should be done only on the training set]]
- [[denote:20220304T201608][Choices for variables to eliminate should be made using the training set]]
