#+title: Linear regression

Linear regression models a relationship between response (dependent) variables and explanatory (independent) variables.

Linear regression with a single explanatory variable is called [[denote:20220215T222053][simple linear regression]] and with more than one explanatory variables is known as [[denote:20220215T222123][multiple linear regression]].

Two common forms of regularization are
- [[denote:20220215T222308][ridge regression]]
- [[denote:20220215T222358][lasso regression]]
