Example: [[denote:20220218T214915][?Asymptotic series of the gamma function]]

If there is a zero derivative in the interval from \( a \) to \( b \) and the function is concave,
the integral is dominated by the global maximum. The rigourous statement is given through [[denote:20220320T004042][Watson's lemma]].
