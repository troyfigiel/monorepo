#+title: Confounders do not impact predictions in a single dataset
#+filetags: :stub:

When we have a dataset from which we want to predict a variable, we are ultimately not looking for
a causal effect and only care about predictive power.

If it turns out there is a confounding variable in our dataset, it will have the same effect both
in the training data and the testing data given proper randomization.

Such a confounding behaviour can however have an effect when we try to apply these predictions to a
different dataset, because [[denote:20220225T084945][Confounders lead to poorly generalizable models]].

* TODO
Give an example where it does not impact the predictions. Maybe the Titanic dataset to keep in line
with the example I would like to do for [[denote:20220225T084945][Confounders lead to poorly generalizable models]].
