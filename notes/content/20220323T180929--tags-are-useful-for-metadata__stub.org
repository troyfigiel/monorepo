#+title: Tags are useful for metadata
#+filetags: :stub:

Maintaining these notes requires some forms of metadata to keep of track which notes need to be
cleaned up, which notes need to be fleshed out, etc. as a reminder to my future self of which notes
are in a stable state and which ones still need work.
