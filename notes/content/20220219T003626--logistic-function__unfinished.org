Because the [[denote:20220320T161457][Standard logistic function]] standard logistic function has an image lying between 0 and
1 and is monotonically increasing, it can be seen as the cumulative distribution of the [[denote:20220320T160854][Standard
logistic distribution]].

Similarly, the [[denote:20220219T003626][Logistic function]] relates to the [[denote:20220320T152009][Logistic distribution]].

The inverse of the standard logistic function is known as the [[denote:20220320T154600][Logit function]] and hence is the
quantile function of the [[denote:20220320T152009][Logistic distribution]].
