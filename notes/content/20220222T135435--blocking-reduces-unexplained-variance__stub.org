#+title: Blocking reduces unexplained variance
#+filetags: :stub:

If we arrange our experiments in groups that are similar, the random variables associated to the
samples within a group are likely to be more strongly correlated with each other. This means that
comparing differences within a group becomes much simpler.

For example, if we have a pair \( (X, Y) \) of random variables, we can minimize the inherent
variation of our test statistic \( X - Y \) by maximizing \( \mathrm{Cov}(X, Y) \) so that we
ultimately minimize \( \mathrm{Var}(X-Y) = \mathrm{Var}(X) + \mathrm{Var}(Y) - 2 \mathrm{Cov}(X, Y) \).
