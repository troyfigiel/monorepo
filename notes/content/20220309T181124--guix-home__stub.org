#+title: Guix Home
#+filetags: :stub:

A user's home environment normally consists of three parts:
- Software
- Configuration
- State

In other Linux distros, configuration is a form of global state, which makes it unreliable, because [[denote:20220309T180541][Global state is evil]].

Because [[denote:20220315T132511][Files in the GNU store can only be changed by the Guix build daemon]] we cannot change the
generated configurations by Guix Home directly. We can remove a symlink manually and create our own
config file, but then if we call the home activation script again, all of this manual configuration will
be backed-up and the symlinks restored.
