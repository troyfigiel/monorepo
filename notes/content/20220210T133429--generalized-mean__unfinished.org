The generalized mean, also known as HÃ¶lder mean or power mean, is defined as

\[ M_p (x_1, ..., x_n) = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^p \right)^{1 / p} \]

For some special values, this leads to

- [[denote:20220210T133813][Maximum]] \( p \rightarrow \infty \)
- [[denote:20220210T134846][Cubic mean]] \( p = 3 \)
- [[denote:20220210T134950][Root mean square]] \( p = 2 \)
- [[denote:20220210T131937][Arithmetic mean]] \( p = 1 \)
- [[denote:20220210T132154][Geometric mean]] \( p \rightarrow 0 \)
- [[denote:20220210T132205][Harmonic mean]] \( p = -1 \)
- [[denote:20220210T135108][Minimum]] \( p \rightarrow - \infty \)

Moreover, using [[denote:20220210T135234][Jensen's inequality]] we may prove that

\[ M_p (x_1, ..., x_n) \leq M_q (x_1, ..., x_n) \]

when \( p < q \) with strict equality only for \( x_1 = x_2 = ... = x_n \).
