Where it happens:
- [[denote:20220221T233800][Emacs]]
- [[denote:20220303T092333][GNU Guix]]

It does not mean it is necessarily difficult to get started, but that there is a clear development
from user to programmer the more you get to know about configuring the program. This especially
happens when there is no clear distinction between code and data (see: [[denote:20220314T125954][Duality between code and
data]]). For example, this can happen with languages in the [[denote:20220220T094628][Lisp]] family.

This is also reflected in the documentation. Documentation to get started might happen on a general
level, but at some point to continue improving configurations, users are redirected to
[[denote:20220316T134414][Self-documenting code]] and [[denote:20220316T134909][Software tests]].

This allows for:
- a very high skill-cap
- recruiting new software maintainers from advanced users

The latter making this type of development especially helpful in the case of [[denote:20220316T135047][Open source software]].
