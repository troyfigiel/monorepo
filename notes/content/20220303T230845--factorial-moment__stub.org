The factorial moments are expectation values of [[denote:20220303T230907][Falling factorials]]. They are useful for studying
the moments of non-negative integer valued random variables.

[[denote:20220303T231108][Factorial moments are related to raw moments through Stirling numbers of the second kind]].

They can be calculated through the [[denote:20220303T231317][Factorial moment generating function]].
