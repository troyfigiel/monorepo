* What is a confounder?
A confounder is a variable that influences both the [[denote:20220225T083338][Dependent variable]] and the [[denote:20220225T083408][Independent
variable]]. The existence of confounders makes the phrase [[denote:20220225T083526][Correlation does not imply causation]]
quantitative. To calculate the effect of confounders, we use [[denote:20220225T084003][Do-calculus]].

* Confounders and predictions
Confounders play a large role in statistics since we will only be able to observe correlation
directly. However, [[denote:20220225T084455][Confounders do not impact predictions in a single dataset]] making them less of a direct
problem. Nonetheless, [[denote:20220225T084945][Confounders lead to poorly generalizable models]].
