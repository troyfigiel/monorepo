#+title: Phi coefficient
#+filetags: :stub:

The phi coefficient is a [[denote:20220302T125352][Correlation coefficient]] used to measure association between two binary variables.

# TODO: Is this true?
When restricted to binary variables, [[denote:20220211T100443][Pearson correlation coefficient]], [[denote:20220302T154115][Kendall rank correlation
coefficient]] and [[denote:20220302T154133][Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] all agree with the phi coefficient.

The phi coefficient can be calculated from a [[denote:20220302T203704][Confusion matrix]] as

\[
\phi = \frac{TP \times TN - FP \times FN}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}
\]
