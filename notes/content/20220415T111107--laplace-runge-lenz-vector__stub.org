This vector is a [[denote:20220415T111015][Constant of motion]] when the only acting force is an inverse-square, central force.

It is defined as

\[
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{L} - m k \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

The [[denote:20220415T111559][Apsidal precession]] of planetary orbits was used to verify the theory of [[denote:20220415T111624][General relativity]]
which predicts a small effective inverse-cubic correction to the classical inverse-square force.
