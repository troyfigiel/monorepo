#+title: Multicollinearity
#+filetags: :stub:

Multicollinearity is a phenomenon where some variables in a set of [[denote:20220225T083408][Independent variables]] can be
linearly predicted from each other with a high degree of accuracy. If there is an exact linear
dependence between the variables, we call this [[denote:20220302T110744][Perfect multicollinearity]].

This can cause several isses:
- [[denote:20220302T110128][Linear regression coefficients change erratically upon slight data perturbations]]
- [[denote:20220302T110514][Linear regression coefficients may be significant together but not individually]]

Care should be taken when it comes to checking for collinearity, because [[denote:20220302T111521][High multicollinearity can not always be observed from pairwise correlation]]

However, [[denote:20220302T112313][Multicollinearity does not bias results]].

# TODO: Is there a link to Confounders?
# They both lead to poorly generalizable models but both do not affect in-sample predictions
