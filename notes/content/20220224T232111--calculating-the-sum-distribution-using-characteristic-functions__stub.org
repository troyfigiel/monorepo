#+title: Calculating the sum distribution using characteristic functions
#+filetags: :stub:

The [[denote:20220210T210826][Characteristic function]] of the sum of two independent random variables \( X \) and \( Y \)
satisfies

\[
\varphi_{X + Y}(t) = \varphi_X(t) \varphi_Y(t)
\]

This follows directly from the fact that [[denote:20220224T224802][Linear relations of random variables lead to simple
relations between characteristic functions]].

Because [[denote:20220224T230543][The characteristic function uniquely determines the probability distribution]], this can
often be useful to determine the sum distribution of two independent random variables.

Add some examples
