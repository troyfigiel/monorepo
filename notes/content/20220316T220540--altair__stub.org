#+title: Altair
#+filetags: :stub:

As a [[denote:20220220T094641][Python]] wrapper around [[denote:20220316T220552][Vega-Lite]]. It is an example of [[denote:20220314T131430][Declarative programming]].

Altair embeds all data in the front-end so it is not well-suited for larger datasets.

Not only comes with [[denote:20220316T220530][Grammar of graphics]], but also has its own idea of [[denote:20220317T214156][Grammar of interactions]].
