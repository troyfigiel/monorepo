#+title: Interpretation of Lagrange multipliers
#+filetags: :stub:

In [[denote:20220210T210151][Statistical mechanics]], the inverse temperature, denoted by \( \beta \), is the [[denote:20220326T235451][Lagrange
multiplier]] appearing if we maximize the entropy (according to the [[denote:20220215T230625][Principle of maximum entropy]])
with the constraint that the total energy is fixed.

Why exactly?
