The term entropy appears in two at first seemingly different contexts:
- [[denote:20220210T200631][Thermodynamics]] and [[denote:20220210T210151][statistical mechanics]]
- [[denote:20220210T200903][Information theory]]

Entropy is defined as the expected [[denote:20220328T201613][Information content]].

There are different types of entropy:
- [[denote:20220328T234602][Boltzmann entropy]]
- [[denote:20220328T234610][Gibbs entropy]]
- [[denote:20220404T200549][Von Neumann entropy]]
- [[denote:20220404T200557][Shannon entropy]]
