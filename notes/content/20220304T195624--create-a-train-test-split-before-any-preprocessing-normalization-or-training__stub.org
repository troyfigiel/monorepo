#+title: Create a train-test split before any preprocessing, normalization or training
#+filetags: :stub:

If we use a [[denote:20220303T132609][Train-test split]], the intended purpose of the test set is to allow us to determine how
good our algorithm performs. In other words, we split the data as soon as we receive it and only
use it once we have to check our model performance.

For this to work
- [[denote:20220304T200642][Both the training and test sets must be representative of the whole population]]
- [[denote:20220304T200835][The training and test sets must be properly randomized]]
