#+title: Speed layer
#+filetags: :stub:

The speed layer is part of the [[denote:20221028T145644][Lambda architecture]].
Whenever we receive data from a [[denote:20221028T150050][Data stream]], the speed layer is responsible for creating predictions
of any already deployed [[denote:20221028T152143][Machine learning models]]. This is done in real-time unlike the model training in the [[denote:20221028T151542][Batch layer]].
