#+title: Ignoring files in git
#+filetags: :stub:

The standard way of ignoring a file using git is by setting it in `.gitignore`. However, there are
more ways to do so:
- Add the file to `.git/info/exclude` for project-level ignoring
- Add the file to `~/.config/git/ignore` for user-level ignoring
