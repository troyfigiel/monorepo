These are
- Logical models
- Reasons models are similar to how humans reason (if-then) so very interpretable (see: [[denote:20220303T134927][Interpretable machine learning]])
- Building blocks of many other algorithms

[[denote:20220210T200903][Information theory]] is used to build decision trees.

Othe algorithms building forth on decision trees:
- [[denote:20220310T125857][Random forest]]
- [[denote:20220310T125913][Boosting]]

They normally do not perform well with [[denote:20220318T203341][One-hot encoding]].
