#+title: Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics
#+filetags: :stub:

If a system is isolated, the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics states that every
accessible [[denote:20220405T214050][Microstate]] is equally likely.

Although every [[denote:20220405T214050][Microstate]] is equally likely, it is possible that there are many more [[denote:20220405T214050][Microstates]]
leading to the same [[denote:20220405T214025][Macrostate]]. This idea might involve the [[denote:20220210T091048][Central limit theorem]].
