#+title: Measure-theoretic basis of probability theory
#+filetags: :stub:

- [[denote:20220327T140506][Measure theory]]
- Unification of [[denote:20220303T223003][Discrete probability distribution]] and [[denote:20220327T135342][Continuous probability distribution]]
- This avoids [[denote:20220327T135409][Bertrand's paradox]] because you specify a measure to integrate against instead of
  assuming one
- It also allows us to describe more exotic distributions that are neither discrete nor continuous.
  ([[denote:20220223T093148][Zero-inflated model]])
- And more exotic distributions such as the [[denote:20220327T140643][Cantor distribution]], which showcases the power of the
  measure-theoretic approach.
