* TODO
What is the intuition behind this result?

* As a corollary
This formula is a special case of [[denote:20220223T205238][Faulhaber's formula]].

* Formal statement
For any natural number \( n \), the following equality holds:

\[
(1 + ... + n)^{2} = 1^{3}+ ... + n^{3}
\]

In fact, due to the formula for the [[denote:20220223T190631][sum of natural numbers]], this may be rewritten as

\[
1^{3} + ... + n^{3} = \frac{nÂ²(n+1)^{2}}{4}
\]

* Proof
We can use induction for this result. It clearly holds for \( n = 1 \).

Now assume it holds for a natural number \( n \), then

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
(1 + ... + n + n+1)^{2} & = (1 + ... + n)^{2} + 2(n+1)(1 + ... + n) + (n+1)^{2} \\
& = (1 + ... + n)^{2} + 2(n+1)\frac{1}{2}n(n+1) + (n+1)^{2} \\
& = (1 + ... + n)^{2} + (n+1)^{3} \\
& = 1 + ... + (n+1)^{3}
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

Where the second equality follows due to the [[denote:20220223T190631][sum of natural numbers]] and the final equality due to
the induction hypothesis. \( \blacksquare \)
