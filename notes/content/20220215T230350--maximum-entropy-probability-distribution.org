#+title: Maximum entropy probability distribution

A maximum entropy probability distribution is a probability distribution that maximizes the entropy within a class of distribution. The [[denote:20220215T230625][Principle of maximum entropy]] states that with nothing else known, we should pick this distribution as the least-informative default.

Relevant classes are often those for which measurable quantitaties (such as moments) are constrained to be constants.

There are many examples of maximum entropy distributions:
