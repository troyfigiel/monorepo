#+title: Index notes
#+filetags: :stub:

The purpose of index notes is to quickly move to a note as well as have a single page view of all
the important ideas in a specific context.

- [[denote:20220323T181020][Index notes are more flexible than tags]]
- Index notes should go down two levels of abstraction. One level is too shallow, but three or more
  gives too much information in a single index note.
- Indices are used as a "save point" for our thoughts. We often continue a train of thought from a
  while back from a specific important point / principle / idea / major concept we remember.
  Indices should capture this so we can quickly get to where we need to be.
