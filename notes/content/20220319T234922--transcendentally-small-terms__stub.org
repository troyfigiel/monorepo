#+title: Transcendentally small terms
#+filetags: :stub:

These are terms that are much smaller than any non-negative power of \( \epsilon \) as \( \epsilon
\rightarrow 0 \) or of \( \frac{1}{x} \) as \( x \rightarrow \infty \).

TST are important, because they cause a serious kind of non-uniqueness and other troubles.


The standard example is \( e^{-x} \) which has the same asymptotic expansion as \( 0 \) in terms of
powers of \( \frac{1}{x} \). In fact, any constant times this function has the same asymptotic
expansion, which can lead to big numerical differences at any finite \( x \) even though they have the same asymptotic expansion.

[[denote:20220319T110945][Hyperasymptotics]] deals with this = Asymptotics beyond all orders.

Trouble occurs because \( e^{-z} \) is not analytic at \( z = \infty \) in the complex plane. It
has an [[denote:20220319T120008][Essential singularity]].
