#+title: The normal distribution is the only distribution with all cumulants vanishing from a certain order on

# TODO: Calculate the cumulant generating function of the normal distribution
Because the cumulant generating function of the normal distribution is \( K(t) = \mu t +
\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 t^2 \), we know that all cumulants \( \kappa_{m>2} = 0 \).

Remarkably, an even stronger converse statement holds. If \( \kappa_{m>k} = 0 \) for some \( k \),
then the probability distribution is normal and the minimal \( k = 2 \).

# TODO: Find this appendix again. It was difficult to find.
