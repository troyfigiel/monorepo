#+title: Large deviations theory
#+filetags: :stub:

Whereas the [[denote:20220210T091048][Central limit theorem]] tells us that the probability distribution of the mean approaches
the [[denote:20220210T091147][Normal distribution]] for large sample sizes, large deviations theory concerns itself with giving
a better approximation for the tail behaviour. In other words, it allows us to more accurately
describe \( \mathbb{P}(\bar{X} > x) \).

The main result in large deviations theory, is the rather sharp bound

# TODO: What is the name of this statement?
\[
\mathbb{P}(\bar{X} > x) = e^{-N I(x)}
\]

where \( N \) is the sample size and \( I(x) \) is known as the [[denote:20220323T085535][Rate function]].
