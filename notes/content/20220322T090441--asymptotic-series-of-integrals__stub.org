#+title: Asymptotic series of integrals
#+filetags: :stub:

Asymptotic series of integrals appear very often when we solve [[denote:20220210T125727][Differential equations]] using
techniques like the [[denote:20220322T095706][Laplace transformation]] or the [[denote:20220224T223654][Fourier transformation]].

Asymptotics will be able to tell us the long-time or the far-field behaviour of these integrals
when we cannot solve them in closed form, allowing us to still extract interesting behaviour of the
solutions.

For a list of examples, see [[denote:20220319T103406][!Asymptotic series of integrals]].

There are several well-known [[denote:20220322T110319][!Techniques for constructing asymptotic series of integrals]].
