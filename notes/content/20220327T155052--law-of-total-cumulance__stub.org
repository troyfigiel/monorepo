#+title: Law of total cumulance
#+filetags: :stub:

The law of total cumulances allows us in particular to calculate the [[denote:20220303T233441][Cumulants]] of [[denote:20220303T210545][Mixture models]]
and [[denote:20220223T222455][Compound Poisson distributions]].

For special cases this leads to:
- [[denote:20220223T223732][Law of total expectation]]
- [[denote:20220327T155042][Law of total probability]]
- [[denote:20220327T155024][Law of total variance]]
