#+title: Least squares regression
#+filetags: :stub:

There is both [[denote:20220216T090727][Linear least squares]] regression as well as [[denote:20220303T195546][Non-linear least squares]] regression.

For linear least squares, we assume the [[denote:20220225T083338][Dependent variable]] linearly depends on the parameters of
the model. [[denote:20220303T195827][Linear regression does not mean the dependent variable depends linearly on the
independent variable]].
