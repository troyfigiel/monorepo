#+title: Characteristic function

The characteristic function \( \varphi_X(t) \) of a probability distribution of a random variable \( X \)
is defined as the expectation value

\[
\varphi_{X}(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{itX}]
\]

This can be understood as the [[denote:20220224T223654][Fourier transform]] of the [[denote:20220210T091919][Probability density]] when the latter exists.

Nonetheless, [[denote:20220224T220317][Every probability distribution has a characteristic function]] which makes it well
suited for formal appendixs as well as many applications.

Because of its simple definition, [[denote:20220224T224802][Linear relations of random variables lead to simple relations between characteristic functions]].

For various characteristic functions, see [[denote:20220304T093552][!Characteristic function]].
