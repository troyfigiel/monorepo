Lagrangian mechanics is defined through the [[denote:20220412T201834][Euler-Lagrange equation]]. By applying a [[denote:20220323T085704][Legendre
transformation]] to the [[denote:20220310T200705][Lagrangian]], we find the [[denote:20220324T213756][Hamiltonian]] and [[denote:20220324T213832][Hamiltonian mechanics]].
