#+title: Lennard-Jones potential
#+filetags: :stub:

This is a potential of the form

\[
V_{\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4 \epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left(
\frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^6 \right]
\]

This potential is often used, because it is simple but still gives rise to various phenomena absent
from simpler models.

The minimum of the potential is located at \( r = 2^{1/6} \sigma \).
