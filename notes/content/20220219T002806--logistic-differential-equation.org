The logistic differential equation is a simple first-order non-linear ODE of the form

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}f(x)}{\mathrm{d}x} = f(x) \left( 1 - f(x) \right)
\]

with the boundary condition \( f(0) = 1/2 \). Its solution is known as the [[denote:20220219T003626][logistic function]].

A typical application of the logistic equation is to model population growth.

* TODO
This is related to the [[denote:20220218T235052][Lotka-Volterra equations]], for one species somehow? Not sure how.
