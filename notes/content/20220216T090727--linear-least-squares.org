#+title: Linear least squares

Linear least squares is a form of [[denote:20220215T221824][Linear regression]] with a loss function that loosely takes the form of the
squares of residuals.

There are several different implementations of linear least squares regression, valid for different scenarios

- [[denote:20220216T090941][ordinary least squares]]
- [[denote:20220216T090952][weighted least squares]]
- [[denote:20220216T091004][generalized least squares]]

# TODO: Make into a separate note
This regression has a closed-form solution.

# TODO: Does the linear least squares always have an exact solution?
