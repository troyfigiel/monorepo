#+title: Bertrand's theorem
#+filetags: :stub:

Betrand's theorem states that there are only two central-force, scalar potentials such that all of
its bound orbits are closed orbits.

These two types of potentials either derive from the inverse-square central force with \( V(r) = -k
/ r \) or from the
radial [[denote:20220408T210557][Harmonic oscillator]] with \( V(r) = k r^2 / 2 \).
