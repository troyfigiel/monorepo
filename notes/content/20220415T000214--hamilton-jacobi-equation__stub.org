#+title: Hamilton-Jacobi equation
#+filetags: :stub:

This equation describes an alternative formulation of [[denote:20220324T213920][Classical mechanics]]. It can be understood as
a special case of the [[denote:20220415T000341][Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation]].

\[
-\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = H \left( \mathbf{q}, \frac{\partial S}{\partial \mathbf{q}}, t \right)
\]

The aim of this formulation of [[denote:20220324T213920][Classical mechanics]] is to find a generating function for a [[denote:20220415T005541][Canonical
transformation]] such that the transformed [[denote:20220324T213756][Hamiltonian]] (also called the [[denote:20220415T005646][Kamiltonian]]) is identically
zero.

This formulation of [[denote:20220324T213920][Classical mechanics]] is especially interesting for two reasons:
1. The generating function ([[denote:20220415T005712][Hamilton's principal function]]) can be identified with the classical
   [[denote:20220310T200840][Action]].
2. This formulation treats waves and particles on equal footing and it is this equation that is
   recovered from the [[denote:20220415T010018][Classical limit]] of the [[denote:20220415T005843][Schr√∂dinger equation]].

If the [[denote:20220324T213756][Hamiltonian]] is time-independent, we can express a solution \( S \) in terms of [[denote:20220416T110450][Hamilton's
characteristic function]] \( W(\mathbf{q}) \) as \( S(\mathbf{q}, t) = W(\mathbf{q}) - E t \) where

\[
H \left( \mathbf{q}, \frac{\partial S}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \right) = E
\]
