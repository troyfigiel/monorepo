#+title: Shattered set
#+filetags: :stub:

The idea of shattered sets plays an important role in [[denote:20220325T143015][Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory]].

If \( A \) is a set and \( C \) is a class of sets, then \( C \) shatters \( A \) if for each
subset \( a \subset A \) there is a \( c \in C \) such that \( a = c \cap A \).
