- Different reparametrizations lead to different [[denote:20220327T135449][Prior distributions]]. A distribution is
  uninformative only for a specific parametrization.
- In [[denote:20220210T210151][Statistical mechanics]], [[denote:20220325T231553][Liouville's theorem]] gives a basis for using the measure that comes from
  the [[denote:20220324T213832][Hamiltonian mechanics]] of the system ([[denote:20220327T135701][Symplectic geometry]]).

  # TODO: This is the unique measure that is time-invariant for the system. How to prove this?
