#+title: Linear relations of random variables lead to simple relations between characteristic functions
#+filetags: :stub:

If we have a sequence of numbers \( a_1, ..., a_n \) and independent random variables
\( X_1, ..., X_n \), the characteristic function of the sum

\[
S_{n} = \sum\limits_{m=1}^n a_m X_m
\]

satisfies

\[
\varphi_{S_n}(t) = \prod\limits_{m=1}^n \varphi_{X_m}(a_m t)
\]

This is especially useful in two special cases, namely to

- [[denote:20220224T232111][Calculating the sum distribution using characteristic functions]]

And to prove the central limit theorem using characteristic functions. See: [[denote:20220224T231155][!Central limit theorem]].
