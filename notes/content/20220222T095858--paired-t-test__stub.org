The paired t-test is an example of a t-test where we compare to samples by pairing each observation
in another sample based on a second variable. For example, day on which they were measured.

If there is a true difference between the pairs, the [[denote:20220222T100120][paired t-test is more powerful than unpaired
t-test]]. However, this only works if we have a natural pairing in our data.

Pairing is an example of the more general notion of [[denote:20220222T135307][blocking]].
