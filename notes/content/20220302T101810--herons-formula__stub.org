#+title: Heron's formula
#+filetags: :stub:

Heron's formula is used to calculate the area of a triangle when all three sides of the triangle
are known.

It is not necessary to know the angles of the triangle to apply the formula.

If the side lengths are \( a, b, c \), then the area is given by

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \).
