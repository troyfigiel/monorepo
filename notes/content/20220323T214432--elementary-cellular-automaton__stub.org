#+title: Elementary cellular automaton
#+filetags: :stub:

An elementary cellular automaton is an example of a one-dimensional [[denote:20220323T214500][Cellular automaton]] with two
conditions:

1. Each cell can only be in the state 0 or the state 1
2. The state of the next generation of a cell only depends on its current state and that of its
   immediate neighbours.

Elementary cellular automata are usually named and classified using the [[denote:20220323T215112][Wolfram code]].

Although the rules of these automata are very simple, they can still give rise to extremely complex
behaviour. For example, it is known that [[denote:20220323T220229][Rule 110 is Turing complete]].
