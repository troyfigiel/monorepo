#+title: Student's t-distribution

The Student's t-distribution is a family of probability distributions characterized by a single parameter \( \nu \) known as the degrees of freedom.

Since the [[denote:20220215T230030][mean of normally distributed samples follows the t-distribution]], the t-distribution is the basis of the [[denote:20220215T230236][Student's t-test]].
