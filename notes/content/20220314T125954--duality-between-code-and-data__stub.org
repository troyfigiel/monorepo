#+title: Duality between code and data
#+filetags: :stub:

What is meant with the duality of code and data, is that there is no clear separation between what
is considered code and what is considered data. Ultimately, for a computer there are only bits and
the ideas of code and data as separate entities are an [[denote:20220314T131014][Emergent phenomenon]].

The phrases [[denote:20220314T130302][Code as data]] and [[denote:20220314T130308][Data as code]] refer to unidirectional instances of this duality. However,
sometimes such a distinct separation is not appropriate.

Examples:
- [[denote:20220314T131316][First-class functions]] (because a function is both a piece of code executing a series of steps as
  well as data that can be passed around as an entity)
- [[denote:20220314T130121][Metaprogramming]]
- [[denote:20220314T131358][Self-modifying code]]
- [[denote:20220314T131430][Declarative programming]]
- [[denote:20220314T131502][Configuration script]]
