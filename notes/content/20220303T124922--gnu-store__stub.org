#+title: GNU store
#+filetags: :stub:

Named the GNU store after the location it stores its builds `/gnu/store`. It is an example of [[denote:20220218T231036][Content-addressable storage]].

Packages are built all separately in the GNU store and after that, [[denote:20220303T092333][GNU Guix]] simply points to the
files in the store. This cannot break the operating system or home environment, because every
result of a package build has a hash prefix. Any change will create a new hash.

This also allows for example installing different versions of the same package.

Note also that [[denote:20220315T132511][Files in the GNU store can only be changed by the Guix build daemon]].
