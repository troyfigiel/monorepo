#+filetags: :stub:

The sign test is a [[denote:20220301T163947][Non-parametric test]] which is used for [[denote:20220301T164106][Paired data]] with a [[denote:20220301T164354][Total order]].

For paired observations of random variables \( X \) and \( Y \), the sign test allows us to test the null
hypothesis \( X = Y \). [[denote:20220301T171954][The sign test is a special case of the binomial test]].

# TODO: Paired tests often have unpaired equivalents. How to write this out?
The unpaired equivalent of this test is [[denote:20220301T171134][Mood's median test]].

Although the sign test is broadly applicable, [[denote:20220301T172420][When other tests can be applied, the sign test is often the least powerful]]
