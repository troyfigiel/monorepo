#+title: ?A parabola is the equidistant set of a line and a point
#+filetags: :appendix:stub:

By rotation, translation and scaling we can assume the line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is defined by \( y = -1/2 \) and the point by \( (x, y) = (0, 1/2) \) for \( (x, y) \) a set of coordinates of \(
\mathbb{R}^2 \).

Now the distance from a point \( (x, y) \) to the line is given by \( y + 1/2 \) whereas the distance to
the point is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1/2)^2} \).

Equating the squares leads to

\[
x^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 = (y + 1/2)^2
\]

from which we derive \( y = x^2 \).

Conversely, given a parabola \( y = a x^2 + b x + c \), we can always complete the square to

\[
y = a \left( x - \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4 a}
\]

In other words, we translate \( x \rightarrow x - \frac{b}{2 a} \), scale by \( x \rightarrow a x
\) and then translate \( y \rightarrow y + c - \frac{b^2}{4 a} \).
