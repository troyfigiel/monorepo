#+title: Data stream
#+filetags: :stub:

A data stream collects data in a continuous fashion.

This does not have the [[denote:20221028T150802][Latency]] that [[denote:20221028T150511][Batch processing]] has, so we can deploy models continuously.

# TODO: Why exactly? Explain in more detail
Due to the [[denote:20221028T151112][CAP theorem]], data streaming runs into problems regarding consistency of data.
These problems are alleviated through architectural choices such as through the [[denote:20221028T145644][Lambda architecture]].
