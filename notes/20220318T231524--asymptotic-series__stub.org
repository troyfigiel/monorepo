#+title: Asymptotic series
#+filetags: :stub:

Asymptotic series often arise when we are [[denote:20220322T095951][Extracting asymptotic series from integrals]]. However, the
definitions encompass a broader range of applications, for example including [[denote:20220322T101340][Asymptotic series of sums]].

# TODO: How to make precise the optimal number of terms?
[[denote:20220322T110738][Convergent series versus asymptotic series]]. Also, there is often an optimal number of terms to take
in an asymptotic expansion.

It is common to calibrate a new technique against exactly solvable problems that exhibit a desired behaviour.

Although generally things will work out, one has to be careful about [[denote:20220322T094641][Uniqueness of asymptotic series]].

For a list of common asymptotic series, see [[denote:20220319T103406][!Asymptotic series]].

* Formal definition
# TODO: This needs significant cleaning
1)  \( f(x) \sim g(x) \) means \( f \) is asymptotic to \( g \). So it means

  \[ \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1 \] for some point of interest \( x_0 \).

  Examples:
  - Small angle approximation: \( \sin x \sim x \) as \( x \rightarrow 0 \). Similarly \( \sin x
    \sim x - \frac{x^3}{3!} \)

    But if we include two or more terms, all of them should be correct. We cannot just say \( \sin x \sim x - 117 x^3 \)

2) \( f(x) = O(g(x)) \) means \( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \) is bounded as \( x \rightarrow x_0
   \). Useful for orders of magnitude, if we don't care about the prefactor. For example, \( \sin x = O(x) \) or \( \sin x = x + O(x^3) \). This is known as the [[denote:20220319T092400][Big O notation]].

3) \( f(x) = o(g(x)) \) or more suggestively \( f(x) \ll g(x) \) as \( x \rightarrow x_0 \) means

\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0 \]

For example, \( \sin x = o(1) \) as \( x \rightarrow 0 \). In other words, \( f \) tends to 0
faster than \( g \) does. This is known as the [[denote:20220319T092709][Little o notation]].

4) A series \( \{ \phi_j(x) \} \) is called an "asymptotic sequence" as \( x \rightarrow x_0 \) if
   \( \phi_{j+1}(x) \ll \phi_j(x) \) as \( x \rightarrow x_0 \). For example,

   \[ \frac{1}{x} \gg \frac{1}{x^2} \gg \frac{1}{x^3} \gg ... \text{ as }x \rightarrow \infty \]

5) \( f(x) \) has the asymptotic expansion

   \[ f(x) \sim a_1 \phi_1(x) + a_2 \phi_2(x) + ... \text{ as } x \rightarrow x_0 \]

if \( \{ \phi_j(x) \} \) is an asymptotic sequence and

\[ f(x) - \sum\limits_{j=1}^n a_j \phi_j(x) \ll \phi_n(x) \]

for each \( n = 1, 2, ... \). Equivalently with the partial sum notation, \( S_n(x) =
\sum\limits_{j=1}^n a_j \phi_j(x) \) and \( R_n(x) = f(x) - S_n(x) \), then \( R_n(x) \ll
\phi_n(x)\). (I personally think this definition is clearer than the one before.)

# TODO: Make a separate note for this? This is pretty straightforward though.
This implies additionally that \( R_n(x) = O(\phi_{n+1}(x)) \).
