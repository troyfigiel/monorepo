UMAP has a number of nearest neighbours parameter \( \#NN \), which is arguably the most important parameter
to adjust.

# TODO: We need to extract a lot of details from the UMAP versus t-SNE to here
See [[denote:20220314T200130][UMAP versus t-SNE]] for many more details.

UMAP runs [[denote:20220314T201408][Stochastic gradient descent]] to minimize the cost function.

# TODO: Which cost function does UMAP use?
