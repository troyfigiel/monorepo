#+title: Both Pandas and the Tidyverse allow for pipelining data transformations
#+filetags: :stub:

In the [[denote:20220224T112708][Tidyverse]] this is embedded in the syntax with the `%>%` operator, but the [[denote:20220224T112750][Pandas]] library in
Python allows for a similar pipeline syntax by using [[denote:20220224T113006][method chaining]].

Ultimately, this means both tools are just as capable of transforming data since [[denote:20220224T113221][Data
transformations naturally form a pipeline]].
