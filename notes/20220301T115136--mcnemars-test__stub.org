McNemar's test is used for paired [[denote:20220301T115513][Bernoulli trial]] test whether paired nominal data come from the same Bernoulli distribution.

This is similar to the [[denote:20220222T095858][Paired t-test]], but for outcomes that follow a [[denote:20220210T094457][Bernoulli distribution]].

Under the assumption that there are enough pairs with different outcomes, the test statistic
follows a [[denote:20220211T100838][Chi-squared distribution]].

McNemar's test is the paired variant of the [[denote:20220301T120410][Binomial test]].
