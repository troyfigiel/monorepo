The cumulants of a probability distribution are defined through the [[denote:20220303T233535][Cumulant generating function]].

The first cumulant is the [[denote:20220210T123407][Mean]] and the second the [[denote:20220210T123518][Variance]].

[[denote:20220303T233844][The normal distribution is the only distribution with all cumulants vanishing from a certain order
on]].
