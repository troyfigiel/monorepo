#+title: Loss function versus evaluation metric
#+filetags: :stub:

The [[denote:20220211T085528][Loss function]] is what a machine learning model will minimize during the training phase whereas
an [[denote:20220311T134207][Evaluation metric]] gives you a better, more intuitive understanding of the performance of your
model.

When we are doing [[denote:20220311T134146][Gradient descent]], differentiability of the loss function will make optimization
much easier whereas many evaluation metrics might not be differentiable at all.
