#+title: Closures and objects are equivalent
#+filetags: :stub:

Closures and objects can be considered as the same kind of construction but in different paradigms.
Closures are more common in [[denote:20220314T132424][Functional programming]] and at the very least require the notion of
[[denote:20220314T131316][First-class functions]]. Objects on the other hand appear in [[denote:20220314T132317][Object-oriented programming]].

The unidirectional implications of this equivalence are often states as:
- Closures are a poor man's object
- Objects are a poor man's closure

# TODO: Show that closures and objects are really equivalent.
