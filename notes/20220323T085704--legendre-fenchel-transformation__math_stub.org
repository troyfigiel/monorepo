Duality relationship between points and lines. How?

Related to [[denote:20220322T110349][Integration by parts]].

The Legrende transform of the [[denote:20220303T233535][Cumulant generating function]] is the [[denote:20220323T085535][Rate function]], which is used in [[denote:20220323T084835][Large deviations theory]].

Two differentiable functions \( f \) and \( g \) are Legendre transforms of each other if

\[
g' = (f')^{-1}
\]

In other words, the derivatives are inverse functions of each other. The transformation is an involution.
