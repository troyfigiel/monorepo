There are two different versions of the law of large numbers called the [[denote:20220218T220632][Weak law of large numbers]] and the [[denote:20220218T220643][Strong law of large numbers]].

The law of large numbers states that the sample average approaches the mean of the distribution
when the number of samples approaches infinity.
