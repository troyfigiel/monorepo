#+title: Phase transition
#+filetags: :stub:

A phase transition is a point in parameter space where the thermodynamic potential becomes
non-analytical.

This non-analyticity can only happen in the [[denote:20220326T114020][Thermodynamic limit]], because in a finite system the
partition function is a finite sum of analytical functions of its parameters, hence also analytical.

We normally differentiate phase transitions that are discontinuous ([[denote:20220404T213838][First-order phase transition]])
from phase transitions that are continuous ([[denote:20220404T213845][Second-order phase transition]]).

Normally, an [[denote:20220404T214153][Order parameter]] is used to define the different phases.

At a phase transition, the system is scale-invariant. Completely different systems with many
different degrees of freedom and complex interactions show quantitatively identical behaviour. This
is the idea of [[denote:20220404T214710][Universality]].
