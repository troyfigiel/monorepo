#+title: Rate function
#+filetags: :math:stub:

The rate function (also known as the Cramér function) is defined as the [[denote:20220323T085704][Legendre-Fenchel
transformation]] of the [[denote:20220303T233535][Cumulant generating function]].

# TODO: What does Sanov's theorem state exactly?
It is related to the [[denote:20220323T090123][Kullback-Leibler divergence]] through [[denote:20220323T090134][Sanov's theorem]].

# TODO: How is the rate function related to the entropy?
