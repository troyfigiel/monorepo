#+title: General correlation coefficient
#+filetags: :stub:

Both the [[denote:20220302T154115][Kendall rank correlation coefficient]] and [[denote:20220302T154133][Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] are
special cases of a more general correlation coefficient.

Suppose we have a sample \( \left\{ (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \right\} \). We can define a
generalized correlation coefficient \( \Gamma \) by

\[
\Gamma = \frac{\sum\limits_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}b_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}^2
\sum\limits_{i,j=1}^n b_{ij}^{2}}}
\]

# TODO: What does this x-score and y-score mean?
where \( a_{ij} \) and \( b_{ij} \) are respectively \( x \)-scores and \( y \)-scores with the
only requirement being that \( A = (a_{ij}) \) and \( B = (b_{ij}) \) are anti-symmetric matrices.

To recover the Kendall and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, set \( r_i \) and \( s_i \) to
be the rank of the \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) among all \( x \)'s and \( y \)'s respectively.

Kendall's \( \tau \) is recovered by

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
a_{ij} &= \mathrm{sgn}(r_i - r_j) \\
b_{ij} &= \mathrm{sgn}(s_i - s_j)
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

whereas Spearman's \( \rho \) is recovered by

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
a_{ij} &= r_i - r_j \\
b_{ij} &= s_i - s_j
\end{align}
\end{equation*}
