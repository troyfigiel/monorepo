\[
k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J} \cdot \mathrm{K}^{-1}
\]

It can be interpreted as a conversion factor from temperature to energy. It is customary to set \(
k_B = 1 \). This is a conversion from "human scale" (temperature) to a more fundamental scale
(energy). The scale of temperature was defined before it was understood it had anything to do with
the energy of constituents. Indeed, average energy of molecule is \( E = \frac{3}{2} k_B T \).
