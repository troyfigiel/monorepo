#+title: Markov's inequality

Markov's inequality states that for a non-negative random variable \( X \),

\[
\mathbb{P}(X \geq a) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{a}
\]

This inequality appears in a number of appendixs:
- [[denote:20220218T222930][Markov's inequality can be used to prove Chebyshev's inequality]]
- [[denote:20220218T223505][appendix of generic Chernoff bound from Markov's inequality]]
