The only memoryless distributions are
- [[denote:20220210T094412][geometric distribution]]
- [[denote:20220210T094351][exponential distribution]]

By definition of conditional probability, we have

\[ \mathrm{Pr(X > t + s)} = \mathrm{Pr(X > t + s | X > t)} \mathrm{Pr(X > t)} \]

By definition of memorylessness, we have

\[ \mathrm{Pr(X > t + s | X > t)} = \mathrm{Pr(X > s)} \]

Rewriting these two equations in terms of the [[denote:20220210T124323][survival function]], we find

\( S(t + s) = S(t)S(s) \)

This equation allows us to prove that for any rational number \( t \) we have \( S(t) = S(1)^t \).

In the discrete case this reduces to the [[denote:20220210T094412][geometric distribution]] whereas in the continous case, the only continous function satisfying the above equation for all rational \( t \) is the [[denote:20220210T094351][exponential distribution]].
