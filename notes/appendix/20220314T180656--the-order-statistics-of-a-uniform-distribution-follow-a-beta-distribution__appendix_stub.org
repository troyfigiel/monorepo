#+title: ?The order statistics of a uniform distribution follow a beta distribution
#+filetags: :appendix:stub:

For the uniform distribution \( F_X(x) = x \) and we have

\[
f_{X_{(k)}}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1} \left( 1 - x \right)^{n-k}}{\mathrm{B}(k, n-k+1)}
\]

This can be immediately recognized as the [[denote:20220314T181253][Beta distribution]] \( X_{(k)} \sim \mathrm{Beta}(k, n-k+1) \).
