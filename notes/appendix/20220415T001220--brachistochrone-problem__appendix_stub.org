#+title: ?Brachistochrone problem
#+filetags: :appendix:stub:

We want to find the curve \( y(x) \) that minimizes the time spent traveling for an object moving
without friction due to the influence of gravity.

The total time spent traveling is given by

\[
T = \int\limits_0^a \frac{1}{v(x)} \frac{ds}{dx} \, dx
\]

Because the curve length can be described in terms of the coordinate \( x \) as

\[
\frac{ds}{dx} = \sqrt{1 + (y^{\prime}(x))^2}
\]

and the velocity is given by

\[
v(x) = \sqrt{2 g y(x)}
\]

the brachistochrone problem is solved by extremizing

\[
T[y] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2g}} \int\limits_0^a \sqrt{\frac{1 + (y^{\prime}(x))^2}{y(x)}} \, dx
\]

subject to \( y(0) = 0 \) and \( y(a) = b \).

Now the [[denote:20220412T201834][Euler-Lagrange equation]] leads to

\[
1 + 2 y y^{\prime \prime} + y^{\prime}^2 = 0
\]

This equation can be solved by

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
x(t) &= t - \sin(t) \\
y(t) &= 1 - \cos(t)
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

up to a multiplicative constant multiplying both \( x \) and \( y \).
