* Point mass distribution

\[
G = 0
\]

See:
- [[denote:20220314T184028][?The point mass distribution is the only distribution with vanishing Gini coefficient]].

* Exponential distribution

\[
G = \frac{1}{2}
\]

See:
- [[denote:20220314T184236][?Gini coefficient of the exponential distribution]]

* Uniform distribution

\[
G = \frac{b-a}{3(b+a)}
\]

See:
- [[denote:20220314T185944][?Gini coefficient of the uniform distribution]]
