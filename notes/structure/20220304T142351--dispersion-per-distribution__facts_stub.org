#+title: !Dispersion per distribution
#+filetags: :facts:stub:

* Definition
The dispersion of a random variable \( X \) is defined as

\[
D = \frac{\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\mathbb{E}[X]}
\]

* Poisson distribution

\( D = 1 \)

See:
- [[denote:20220304T142707][!Mean of the Poisson distribution]]
- [[denote:20220304T142721][!Variance of the Poisson distribution]]

* Binomial distribution

\[
D = 1 - p < 1
\]

See:
- [[denote:20220304T142841][!Mean of the binomial distribution]]
- [[denote:20220304T142930][!Variance of the binomial distribution]]

* Bernoulli distribution

\[
D = 1 - p < 1
\]

This is due to the fact that [[denote:20220304T144745][The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial
distribution]].

See:
- [[denote:20220304T144905][!Mean of the Bernoulli distribution]]
- [[denote:20220304T144925][!Variance of the Bernoulli distribution]]

* Negative binomial distribution

\[
D = \frac{1}{1 - p} > 1
\]

See:
- [[denote:20220304T143043][!Mean of the negative binomial distribution]]
- [[denote:20220304T143100][!Variance of the negative binomial distribution]]

* Geometric distribution

\[
D = \frac{1}{p} - 1
\]

See:
- [[denote:20220304T144251][!Mean of the geometric distribution]]
- [[denote:20220304T144308][!Variance of the geometric distribution]]

* Point mass distribution

\[
D = 0
\]

The point mass distribution is the only distribution with vanishing dispersion. This is a direct
corollary of the fact that [[denote:20220303T220832][The point mass distribution is the only distribution with vanishing standard
deviation]].
