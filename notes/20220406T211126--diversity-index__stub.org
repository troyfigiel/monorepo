#+title: Diversity index
#+filetags: :stub:

The diversity index is defined in terms of the [[denote:20220210T133429][Generalized mean]]. More precisely, if \( M_p \) is
the generalized mean,

\[
{}^{q}D = \frac{1}{M_{q-1}} = \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^q \right)^{\frac{1}{1-q}}
\]

In the limit \( q \rightarrow 1 \), this leads to the [[denote:20220406T210435][Perplexity]].
