#+title: Stirling's approximation

Stirling's approximation is an approximation for factorials of the form

\[
n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n
\]

Sometimes it is also written as

\[
\log n! \sim n \log n - n
\]

We can use [[denote:20220218T215354][Stirling's approximation to prove the CLT for the binomial distribution]].

This is an example of an [[denote:20220318T231524][Asymptotic series]]. (See: [[denote:20220218T214915][?Asymptotic series of the gamma function]])

# TODO: Often we need to approximate binomials with the Stirling approximation. Maybe separate note?
Also [[denote:20220323T101536][Stirling's approximation recovers the rate function of the Bernoulli distribution]].
