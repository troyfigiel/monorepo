#+title: Only running a container image can be done reproducibly
#+filetags: :stub:

For at least two reasons:
- Timestamps change, affecting the hash
- If they call a package manager without requiring a fixed hash for a package, they might install a
  later version of a package

This can be especially annoying if you have to build a container for a different architecture and
either the Dockerfiles are not reproducible or somewhere along the way some package versions are different
leading to different results or a broken container. So even building a container from the same
commit hash, might not lead to the same image.
