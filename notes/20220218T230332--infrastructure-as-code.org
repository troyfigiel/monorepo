#+title: Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure through text files that can be interpreted by a computer.

This has several advantages such as
- The definitions may be put under version control.
- All infrastructure code can be stored in a single place.
- It gives an overarching UI to the infrastructure making it more human-readable.

Some examples of IaC tools are:
- [[denote:20220218T230243][Terraform]]
- [[denote:20220218T230731][Ansible]]
