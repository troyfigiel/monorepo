# TODO: Does it? You need to avoid duplicating code in your documentation.
Any idiosyncracies can be explained in comments and splitting code in modules makes the intent
clear. Do not write documentation or comments that just tells you how the low-level implementations
work, but explain the reason behind it, the why. The code itself explains the how in excruciating
detail.

However, configuration is usually more monolithic anyway?
