#+title: Waterfall methodology
#+filetags: :stub:

The waterfall methodology goes through several distinct stages, one after another.
For example, we could have the following stages:
- Plan
- Build
- Test
- Review
- Deploy

The problem with this methodology is that often when problems are encountered, you move back to a previous stage.
This means that with inevitable delays, a product might only be delivered after months or years.

This is often compared to the [[denote:20221027T152420][Scrum methodology]] when describing how not to do software development.
