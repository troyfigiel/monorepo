- It can be used to calculate an asymptotic expansion of \( \log n! = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \log k \) and find [[denote:20220218T213931][Stirling's approximation]]
- It gives an exact result for [[denote:20220223T205238][Faulhaber's formula]], since we have a finite number of correction terms
- It can be used to find the asymptotic expansion for the [[denote:20220314T193000][Harmonic numbers]]
