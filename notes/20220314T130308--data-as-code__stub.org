#+title: Data as code
#+filetags: :stub:

When we work with [[denote:20220218T230332][Infrastructure as code]] and [[denote:20220314T130517][Configuration as code]], we are explicitly treating the
infrastructure and configuration data as code for an interpreter. The interpreter will make sure
that the infrastructure or configuration we specify, will be created.
