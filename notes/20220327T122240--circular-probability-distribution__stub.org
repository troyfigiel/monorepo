#+title: Circular probability distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

A circular distribution is a probability distribution for a random variable with angular values.
Any distribution on the real line can be converted to a circular distribution by wrapping it around
the unit circle. (See [[denote:20220327T123142][Wrapped distribution]])

Examples of circular distributions are:
- [[denote:20220327T122619][Von Mises distribution]]
- [[denote:20220327T122629][Circular uniform distribution]]
- [[denote:20220327T123142][Wrapped distribution]]
