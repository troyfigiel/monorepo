#+title: Compound Poisson distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

Let \( X_{1}, X_{2}, ... \) be independent, identically-distributed random variables and \( N \sim
\mathrm{Pois}(\lambda) \).

The random variable \( Y = \sum\limits_{n=1}^N X_n \) is said to follow a compound Poisson
distribution.

The compound Poisson distribution is an example of a [[denote:20220328T134051][Compound probability distribution]]
