#+title: Power of a test
#+filetags: :stub:

The power of a test is the probability that the null hypothesis is correctly rejected when an
alternative is true.

The power is often denoted by \( 1 - \beta \) where \( \beta \) denotes the probability of a [[denote:20220215T232443][Type
II error]].

Often the power of a test depends on paramaters such as the number of samples or parameters of the
distributions involved. In these cases we talk about the [[denote:20220303T175618][Power function]].
