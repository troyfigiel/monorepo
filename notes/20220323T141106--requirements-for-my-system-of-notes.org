#+title: Requirements for my system of notes

The two main requirements I have for my notes are the following:
- Finding back notes (possibly from a long time ago) is relatively painless
- It is clear how to connect new notes to my older notes

To fulfills these requirements, I find that it is important to keep what I would call [[denote:20220324T232040][Clean notes]]
and remember that [[denote:20220324T222310][Connecting ideas requires a different form of note taking from communicating
ideas]].

[[denote:20220326T093602][The structure of my notes is modeled after the Zettelkasten principle]] and I have taken significant
inspiration from [[denote:20220326T093803][Evergreen note-taking]] throughout many of the concepts I use to write my notes.
