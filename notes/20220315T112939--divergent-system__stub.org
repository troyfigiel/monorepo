#+title: Divergent system
#+filetags: :stub:

A divergent system is a system for which the state of the system is diverging over time from how
the administrators originally set it up.

When systems are managed by individuals by hand, they will at some point become out of sync with
expectations.

It implies bad management of a system and will lead to [[denote:20220301T193147][Configuration drift]] over time. It is lacking
[[denote:20220307T144637][Reproducibility]] making it hard to replicate hardware or software failures to understand where bugs
are coming from.

Examples:
- Setting up a new operating system (that is not declarative)
- Manually setting configurations for cloud infrastructure instead of using [[denote:20220218T230243][Terraform]].
