[[denote:20220310T131257][Machine learning is pattern recognition]].

[[denote:20220306T182041][Machine learning broadly speaking covers only two types of problems]]

[[denote:20220310T133706][Binary classification is the core problem of machine learning]].

Important is also [[denote:20220310T201832][Ockham's razor]]. We try to thwart the [[denote:20220310T231759][Curse of dimensionality]].

[[denote:20220313T115336][Imbalanced data]]

Broadly speaking, the workflow goes like this
- Split train and test set
- Perform any needed data preprocessing and cleaning
- Extract useful features
- Train model
- Evaluate on test set

Potentially we might need a small engineering step before everything, to transform filetypes to a csv or tsv file for example.

Machine learning is used in many different fields:
- [[denote:20220310T133058][Computer vision]]
- [[denote:20220310T133110][Natural language processing]]

There are also important [[denote:20220310T133301][Ethical concerns in machine learning]].

Some examples of [[denote:20221028T152143][Machine learning models]]:
- [[denote:20220215T225444][Logistic regression]]
- [[denote:20220310T125652][Decision tree]]
- [[denote:20220310T125913][Boosting]]
- [[denote:20220310T133824][Support vector machine]]
- [[denote:20220310T125857][Random forest]]
- [[denote:20220306T182240][Neural network]]
- [[denote:20220310T141956][Perceptron]]
- [[denote:20220310T142122][K-nearest neighbours]]
- [[denote:20220322T175742][K-means clustering]]

Some techniques for data transformation commonly used:
- [[denote:20220310T193721][Mapping to higher-dimensional spaces]]

See [[denote:20220311T000230][§Loss functions in machine learning]].

See [[denote:20220311T132845][§Evaluation metrics for machine learning models]].

Besides single algorithms, we can also use [[denote:20220318T150206][Ensemble learning]] techniques.
