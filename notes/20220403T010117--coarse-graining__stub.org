#+title: Coarse-graining
#+filetags: :stub:

There are many different forms of coarse-graining, for example

- [[denote:20220406T205311][Downsampling]]
- Majority vote
- Fourier-space (Like for a [[denote:20220322T175512][JPEG compression]])

# TODO: Which one exactly?
One of the [[denote:20220406T212635][Fundamental properties of information]] is a coarse-graining requirement.

Sum of coarse-grained system plus a weighted sum over the microsystems that have been
coarse-grained out.

This shows that coarse-graining always decreases the entropy.
