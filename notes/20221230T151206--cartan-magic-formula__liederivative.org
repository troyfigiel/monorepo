The Cartan magic formula in differential geometry relates the Lie derivative to the exterior and interior derivatives. For a given vector field \( X \), the Cartan magic formula states that

\[ \mathcal{L}_X = d i_X + i_X d \]

The Cartan magic formula can be proved by showing that the anti-commutator of the exterior and interior derivatives satisfy all the axioms of the Lie derivative [[denote:20221230T152740]].
