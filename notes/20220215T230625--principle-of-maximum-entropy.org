The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution best representing the knowledge of a system, is the one with the largest entropy.

There are two motivations for this:
   1. Maximizing the entropy minimizes the amount of [[denote:20220215T230943][prior information]] of the distribution.
   2. Many physical systems tend to move towards maximal entropy configurations over time.
