"One of the most annoying and most difficult problems in ML."

Normally, a misclassified positive counts the same as a misclassified negative. If we weigh
positive counts differently from negative counts in the [[denote:20220211T085528][Loss function]], we can off-set the effect of
imbalanced data.

Always look at the [[denote:20220301T193147][Configuration drift]] to check the [[denote:20220311T131803][False positive rate]] and the [[denote:20220313T132557][False negative rate]].
