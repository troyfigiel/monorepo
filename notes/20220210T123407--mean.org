There are many different notions of mean. The most common notion is the [[denote:20220210T131937][Arithmetic mean]] which for a set of numbers \( x_1, ..., x_n \) is defined as

\[ \bar{x}_{\mathrm{AM}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \]

Two other well-known notions of mean are the [[denote:20220210T132154][Geometric mean]] and the [[denote:20220210T132205][Harmonic mean]] defined as

\[ \bar{x}_{\mathrm{GM}} = \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \right)^{1 / n} \]
\[ \bar{x}_{\mathrm{HM}} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 1 / x_i} \]

All these notions of means can be combined into a single [[denote:20220210T133429][Generalized mean]].
