It is known that non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients cannot produce primes for every integer input value. For example, consider a polynomial \( P(n) \). If \( P(1) = p \) for some prime number \( p \), \( P(1 + kp) \) must be divisble by \( p \) for any \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \). This follows from the binomial theorem ([[denote:20220223T205208]]).
