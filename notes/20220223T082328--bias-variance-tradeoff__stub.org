#+title: Bias-variance tradeoff
#+filetags: :stub:

The bias-variance tradeoff is the idea that the variance of an estimated parameter is in tension
with the bias in the estimated parameter.

This means that [[denote:20220223T082948][Higher model complexity decreases bias, but increases variance]].
In other words, we need to find a balance between [[denote:20220310T193752][Overfitting]] and [[denote:20220310T230548][Underfitting]].


Example
- [[denote:20220223T083106][bias-variance tradeoff for mean squared error]]
- [[denote:20220223T092119][bias-variance tradeoff for k-nearest neighbours]]
