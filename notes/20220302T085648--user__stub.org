A user on a Linux system is anyone who uses the computer. [[denote:20220302T085815][Linux is a multi user OS]].

The [[denote:20220302T090005][Superuser]] has full access to the operating system. This is intended for administration
purposes.

Current users can normally be found under `/etc/passwd`.

Users always belong to at least one [[denote:20220302T090225][User group]]. When the user is created, a [[denote:20220302T090251][Primary user group]] is
automatically created and the user can belong to several other groups ([[denote:20220302T090315][Secondary user group]]).
