#+title: Behaviour-driven development

Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is a subset of [[denote:20220317T223641][Test-driven development]] (TDD).

Start from requirements and turn these into tests. Ultimately, requirements are what need to be
satisfied, so this structure for example keeps tests decoupled from the underlying design.
