#+title: Mean absolute difference
#+filetags: :stub:

Defined as

\[
\mathrm{MD}(X) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left| X_1 - X_2 \right| \right]
\]

where \( X_1, X_2 \) are random variables, independently and identically distributed as \( X \).

Some nice properties:
- \( \mathrm{MD}(X + c) = \mathrm{MD}(X) \)
- \( \mathrm{MD}(c X) = |c| \mathrm{MD}(X) \)

The mean absolute difference is the L-scale of the [[denote:20220314T164334][L-moment]].
# TODO: Show this? Is trivial though.
