#+title: Generating function
#+filetags: :stub:

A generating function provides a link between a formal power series and a sequence of numbers.

Two common forms of generating functions are the [[denote:20220224T214954][Ordinary generating function]] and the [[denote:20220224T215014][Exponential
generating function]].

Many operations that can be performed on formal power series, can be used to describe properties of
the sequence of numbers.

* Probability theory
Generating functions can be used to calculate the moments of a probability distribution. In this
context, the generating function is known as the [[denote:20220224T220044][Moment generating function]].

Because [[denote:20220224T220122][The moment generating function does not always exist]], the [[denote:20220210T210826][Characteristic function]] is often
used as a replacement because [[denote:20220224T220317][Every probability distribution has a characteristic function]].
