#+title: Uniqueness of asymptotic series
#+filetags: :stub:

One function can be expanded in terms of many different asymptotic series. However, once we fix an
asymptotic series, the coefficients are unique.

This follows from a simple calculation and the [[denote:20220319T102229][?Uniqueness of limits]]:

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x) - \sum\limits_{j=1}^n a_j \phi_j(x)}{\phi_{n+1}(x)} = a_{n+1}
\]

A "natural choice" of choice of asymptotic series is in powers (like a [[denote:20220319T102559][Taylor series]]). When we are
using Taylor series to approximate things, we are using their asymptotic character more than their
convergent character.

Indeed, [[denote:20220319T104305][Every convergent Taylor series is an asymptotic series]].
