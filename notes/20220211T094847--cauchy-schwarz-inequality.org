#+title: Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

For two vectors \( \bold{u} \) and \( \bold{v} \) in an inner product space, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states

\[ \left| \langle \bold{u}, \bold{v} \rangle \right|^2 \leq \langle \bold{u}, \bold{u} \rangle \cdot \langle \bold{v}, \bold{v} \rangle \]

This inequality has a myriad of consequences such as
- [[denote:20220211T095924][triangle inequality follows from Cauchy-Schwary inequality]]
- [[denote:20220211T100400][correlation coefficient is bounded by 1]]
