- Use [[denote:20220310T133922][Regression]] analysis
  - Control for other factors by including them as regressors
  - Use regressors that are necessarily [[denote:20220411T180321][Exogenous variables]]
  - [[denote:20220223T133002][Confounding variables]] are harder to avoid: There must be some outside reason to believe this
    cannot be the cause of the [[denote:20220326T234832][Correlation]].
- Randomization to the rescue: If we fear there might be a confounder underlying a correlation,
  randomization ensures that on *average* the values of both observed and unobserved random
  variables even out. This is why we can make causal statements in randomized [[denote:20220411T181013][Experimental studies]]
  in contrast to [[denote:20220411T181002][Observational studies]].
