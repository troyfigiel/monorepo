#+title: Convergent system
#+filetags: :stub:

Once [[denote:20220301T193147][Configuration drift]] has been observed, a system for which state has diverged from expectations
will be made into a convergent system, i.e. a system where the state changes over time in such a
way as to close the gap between reality and expectations of administrators.

This is usually done through tools like:
- [[denote:20220315T113939][Puppet]]
- [[denote:20220315T113946][Chef]]
- [[denote:20220218T230731][Ansible]]
