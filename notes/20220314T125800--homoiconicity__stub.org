A [[denote:20220220T094616][Programming language]] is called homoiconic if a program written in that language, can be
manipulated as if it were data by that same language. In other words, there exists a [[denote:20220314T125954][Duality
between code and data]].

A famous example of homoiconic languages are the [[denote:20220220T094628][Lisp]] languages. However, also [[denote:20220220T094741][Julia]] is considered
to be a homoiconic language.
