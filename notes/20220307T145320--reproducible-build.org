A program can be reproducibly built if it can be compiled to the exact same binary code as long
as the input to the compiler is the same.

Besides scientific implications, reproducibility is also important from an operational security standpoint.

# TODO: Link to the following topics.
- Timestamps are meaningless for reproducible builds [[denote:20220303T124900]]
- A declarative system is bit-for-bit reproducible [[denote:20220223T233802]]
- Only running a container image can be done reproducibly [[denote:20220301T212917]]

Common phrase: It works on my machine [[denote:20230101T222246]]. Also, dependency hell [[denote:20230101T221135]].
