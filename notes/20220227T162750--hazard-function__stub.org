#+title: Hazard function
#+filetags: :stub:

The hazard function describes the probability of failure in the next step of time. When the time is
continuous, it is defined as

\[
\lambda(t) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\mathbb{P}(t \leq T < t + h | T \geq t)}{h}
\]


where \( T \) is the random variable describing the time of failure.

The hazard function is closely related to the [[denote:20220210T124323][Survival function]], because [[denote:20220227T200208][The survival function is the exponential of the cumulative hazard function]].


# TODO: Expand on the relation between [[id:9fb4ee22-fbdc-4a3b-9bbc-cdc107f63c88][Memoryless]] distributions and a constant hazard function.
