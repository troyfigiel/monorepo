#+title: Avoid premature abstraction

The more components are added to a system, the more complex it becomes. [[denote:20220323T135449][Abstraction is a powerful
tool to fight increasing complexity]], however, care should be taken that simple things are not made
complex by an abstraction.

This can often happen when a programmer or designer introduces an abstraction in anticipation of a
complexity. Instead, you should [[denote:20220323T140245][Refactor when necessary]], keeping principles such as [[denote:20220323T135849][KISS]] and [[denote:20220323T135924][YAGNI]]
in mind.
