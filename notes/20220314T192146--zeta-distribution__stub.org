#+title: Zeta distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

The zeta distribution is a discrete probability distribution with probability mass function

\[
f_s(k) = \frac{k^{-s}}{\zeta(s)}
\]

and \( k \in \{1, 2, ... \} \). It gets its name from the fact that the [[denote:20220223T213833][Riemann zeta function]] is
used as the normalization constant.
