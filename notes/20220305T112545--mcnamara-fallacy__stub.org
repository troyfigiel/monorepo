#+title: McNamara fallacy
#+filetags: :stub:

The McNamara fallacy was named after the US secretary of Defense in the context of the Vietnam war.

It involves
1. Measuring what can easily be measured
2. Disregarding that which cannot be measured easily or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value
3. Presume that what cannot be measured is not important
