In [[denote:20220324T213920][Classical mechanics]] an ensemble is a joint probability distribution \( \rho(\mathbf{p},
\mathbf{q}) \) of the systems internal degrees of freedom. For example, \( \mathbf{q} = (q_1, ... ,
q_{3N}) \) if we have \( N \) particles (for each dimension one).

* [[denote:20220326T111110][Canonical ensemble]]
We have

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{h^n C} \exp \left( \frac{F - E}{k_B T} \right)
\]
