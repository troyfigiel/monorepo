#+title: Coefficient of dispersion
#+filetags: :stub:

The coefficient of dispersion is defined as the ratio

\[
D = \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}
\]

and is only defined for \( \mu > 0 \). It is generally used for positive statistics (such as counts
or waiting times) or when the underlying distribution is assumed to be either the [[denote:20220210T094330][Poisson
distribution]] or the [[denote:20220210T094351][Exponential distribution]]. In those cases, we have \( D = 1 \).

# TODO: Which test is used to check D = 1 ?

When \( D > 1 \) we call the distribution over-dispersed whereas a distribution with \( D < 1 \) is
an under-dispersed distribution.

For various calculations, see [[denote:20220304T142351][?Dispersion]].
