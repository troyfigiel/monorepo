#+title: Truncated distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

A truncated probability distribution is a distribution that is obtained by truncating its domain.

Truncated distributions appear when we can only observe part of the domain of the distribution. For
example, if we look at a school to determine the distribution of ages across the population, we
will only observe the ages that are admitted at the school.
