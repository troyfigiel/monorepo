#+title: Lambda architecture
#+filetags: :stub:

The lambda architecture is a generic architecture that lets us handle [[denote:20221028T150050][Data streams]].

Incoming data is sent to both a [[denote:20221028T151542][Batch layer]] and a [[denote:20221028T151552][Speed layer]].

Predictions created from the [[denote:20221028T151552][Speed layer]] are then sent to the [[denote:20221028T152813][Serving layer]].

The name of this architecture comes from its topology, which resembles the Greek letter lambda.
