#+title: Use CTEs abundantly
#+filetags: :stub:

When writing SQL code, queries can quickly become unreadable due to excessive nesting. This makes
SQL code often difficult to debug.

CTEs not only resolve the amount of nesting, they also make debugging queries much easier since a
query can be checked step by step instead of only as a whole.
