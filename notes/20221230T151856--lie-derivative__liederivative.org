The Lie derivative in differential geometry is used to evaluate the change of a tensor field along the flow of a vector field.

It can be defined both algebraically [[denote:20221230T153105]] as well as in terms of flows [[denote:20221230T153146]]. These two

The Lie derivative is closely related to the exterior and interior product through the Cartan magic formula ([[denote:20221230T151206]]).
