#+title: Exponential family

The single-parameter exponential family is the family of distributions that can be written as

\[
f_X(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{\theta}) = h(\mathbf{x}) \exp \left[ \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{s} \eta_{i}(\mathbf{\theta}) \cdot T_i(\mathbf{x}) - A(\mathbf{\theta}) \right]
\]

The vector \( \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{x}) \) is a [[denote:20220215T213507][sufficient statistic for the exponential family]].

Many well-known distributions are examples of the exponential family: [[denote:20220309T181806][!Exponential family]].
