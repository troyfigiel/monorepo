#+title: logistic differential equation

The logistic differential equation is a simple first-order non-linear ODE of the form

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}f(x)}{\mathrm{d}x} = f(x) \left( 1 - f(x) \right)
\]

with the boundary condition \( f(0) = 1/2 \). Its solution is known as the [[id:f4c1dbf3-0f05-4a68-ba2e-b9f6602789d5][logistic function]].

A typical application of the logistic equation is to model population growth.

* TODO
This is related to the [[id:f590986d-8b66-4737-87d4-64f035b0f05b][Lotka-Volterra equations]], for one species somehow? Not sure how.
