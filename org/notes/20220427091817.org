Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is a subset of [[id:3d6f2f10-7b62-4628-a65d-c16b37b991fd][Test-driven development]] (TDD).

Start from requirements and turn these into tests. Ultimately, requirements are what need to be
satisfied, so this structure for example keeps tests decoupled from the underlying design.
