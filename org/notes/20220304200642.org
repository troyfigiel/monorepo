#+title: Both the training and test sets must be representative of the whole population
#+filetags: :stub:

If the training and tests sets from a [[id:9dcf3a17-31fd-44f5-b886-34424a1df9fd][Train-test split]] do not represent the whole population, it
can happen that the trained model does not generalize well or that the model performance of the
test set is not indicative of the real-world performance.
