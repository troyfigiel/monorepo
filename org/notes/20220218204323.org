#+title: Statistical independence

Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent if and only if

\[
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \mathbb{P}(B)
\]

In terms of conditional probability, this means \( \mathbb{P}(A | B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \) and \( \mathbb{P}(B|A) = \mathbb{P}(B) \).

Two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent if and only if the joint cumulative distribution function satisfies

\[
F_{X, Y}(x, y) = F_X(x) F_Y(y)
\]

This is closely related to the notion of uncorrelated random variables, but it should be noted that there is a [[id:d91909b7-f1b4-446a-9ad3-7254415e75de][difference between independent and uncorrelated random variables]].
