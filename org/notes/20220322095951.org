#+title: Extracting asymptotic series from integrals
#+filetags: :stub:

When we have an integral that we cannot solve exactly, we might still be able to (at least
formally) expand the integrand in a power series. [[id:10d178e4-cf58-4326-af5b-48206039e3a5][Asymptotic series of integrals]] can then be
constructed by basically exchanging the sum and the integral.

This cannot always be done exactly, since this often involves taking a power series outside of its
domain of definition. However, when we look at the partial sums we can obtain exact results that
approximate the original integral quite well.

One of the most basic examples is the [[id:b7103666-aa3d-4df7-8e98-da33cec0cc45][?Asymptotic series of the exponential integral]].
