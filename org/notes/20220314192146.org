#+title: Zeta distribution
#+filetags: :stub:

The zeta distribution is a discrete probability distribution with probability mass function

\[
f_s(k) = \frac{k^{-s}}{\zeta(s)}
\]

and \( k \in \{1, 2, ... \} \). It gets its name from the fact that the [[id:f5683ec8-1982-4357-845a-e007091c738f][Riemann zeta function]] is
used as the normalization constant.
