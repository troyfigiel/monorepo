#+title: Ehrenfest model
#+filetags: :unclean:

* Definition
# TODO: There are many different Ehrenfest models. Can we make a classification? Continuous,
# discrete, aperiodic by allowing a particle to stay in the same urn, multiple urn models.
The Ehrenfest model is a [[id:00fa9c4b-ce93-43a3-b0d8-a99f2aad4625][Markov chain]] model that considers two containers exchanging particles. At
each time step we decide to either do nothing with probability \( \epsilon \) or to pick a particle at random and move it from one container to the other.

If we have a total of \( N \) particles, we may denote by state \( i \) the case where \( i \)
particles are situated in the first container. In that case the [[id:f87cfbed-01da-4bcc-b89f-6a7510e0f213][Transition probability matrix]] takes
the form

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
P_{i, i-1} &= \frac{i}{N}(1-\epsilon) \quad &&\text{ for } i = 1, 2, ..., N \\
P_{i, i+1} &= \frac{N-i}{N}(1-\epsilon) \quad &&\text{ for } i = 0, 1, ..., N-1 \\
P_{i, i} &= \epsilon \quad &&\text{ for } i = 0, 1, ..., N
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

* Steady state
It turns out that there exists a solution \( \pi \) to the [[id:c3723918-d1d7-4be2-9179-87500c4eb836][Detailed balance]] equation

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
\pi_i P_{i, i+1} &= \pi_{i+1} P_{i+1, i} \\
\pi_{i+1} &= \frac{N-i}{i+1} \pi_i
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

These equations are solved by

\[
\pi_i = \binom{N}{i} \pi_0
\]

as immediately follows from [[id:4f4d03fb-f463-4a9d-822b-8f8feae223d2][Induction]] on \( i \). Since the total sum of the probability must equal
to 1 and the fact that [[id:c0c8de45-1f04-4cd0-bf17-4ed141c6a850][?The sum of binomial coefficients is a power of two]], we find

\[
\pi_i = 2^{-N} \binom{N}{i}
\]

Clearly, the Ehrenfest model describes a [[id:f255deb6-9194-457a-8657-5d5c06f51048][Recurrent Markov chain]] because there is a non-zero
probability to be back at the initial state after two steps. On top of that, this model is an
example of an [[id:065bc86e-25c6-41ba-84a6-0c634a3df240][Irreducible Markov chain]], since it is always possible to reach every single state
from every other state. Finally, the Markov chain is also clearly an example of a [[id:e00e1ae4-d048-468f-9b2f-e88b6c9caa31][Periodic Markov
chain]] if \( \epsilon = 0 \).

* Recurrence time
The mean recurrence time \( \tau_i \) is known to satisfy \( \tau_i \pi_i = 1 \) so that

\[
\tau_i = \frac{2^N}{\binom{N}{i}}
\]

This means that for \( i = 0 \) the mean recurrence time grows as \( 2^N \). If \( N = 2n \), we
may express the mean recurrence time \( \tau_n \) in terms of the [[id:2e7f416b-f843-44a1-9234-fe028d2c8b14][Central binomial coefficients]]. By
[[id:1f2a060d-f682-4cb3-8e84-43b0595f84a3][Stirling's approximation]] we can establish

\[
\binom{2n}{n} \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}
\]

so that

\[
\tau_n \sim \sqrt{\pi n}
\]

If we look at a number of particles of the order of the [[id:82cd4b82-3d85-489b-a696-e0171d65fe74][Avogadro number]], \( n = 10^{24} \) and consider the [[id:eb264088-f6a7-44a5-8a67-a82ef13fbb73][Collision
time]] of helium, which is approximately \( 10^{-13} \, s \), as our time step, we see that the mean
recurrence time \( \tau_n \sim 10^{-1} \, s \), whereas \( \tau_0 \sim 4^{10^{24}} \) which is an
astronomically large number.

This shows that a mathematical certainty is not necessarily a practical possibility. However, this
does underline the difference between the [[id:1f2fe34d-c304-4047-9d59-e5382f85c66f][Boltzmann entropy]] and the [[id:69df7ba6-d13b-439b-a246-a691a97129e1][Gibbs entropy]].

* Lumpable Random walk
# TODO: We should make a separate note of this random walk. This is where a lot of interesting math
# comes in, such as harmonic analysis and we can recover quite a few extra results.
Consider the [[id:3e6ed4fc-8d04-4e28-880a-09511262e563][Random walk]] on the hypercube \( \{0, 1\}^N \). Every time step one of the \( N \)
coordinates is chosen at random and switched from 0 to 1 or vice versa. This is a [[id:92eeee9d-841e-4eb6-942b-02042b3918e2][Lumpable Markov
chain]] with respect to the [[id:af7c82a6-dda2-486b-8cb2-3c8e9731e0f8][Hamming weight]], which precisely gives rise to the Ehrenfest model.

This is like a 1D Ising model at infinite temperature at infinite temperature, where we evolve the
system one step at a time and measure the overall magnetization. The magnetization is the number of
particles in a single box.

* Entropy
# TODO: Finish the entropy calculation
To calculate the entropy, we need to calculate the probability that the system is in state \( i \)
at a time step \( t \) after starting in state 0.

* Time until equilibrium
# TODO: This is just calculating averages for Markov chains?
If we denote by \( X(t) \) the random variable denoting the number of particles in the first
container at time step \( t \) and \( \Delta(t) = \mathbb{E}[X(t)] - \frac{N}{2} \), we can calculate (setting \(
\epsilon = 0 \)):

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
\Delta(t+1)
&= \Delta(t) + \frac{N/2 - \Delta(t)}{N} - \frac{N/2 + \Delta(t)}{N} \\
&= \left( 1 - \frac{2}{N} \right) \Delta(t)
\end{align}
\end{equation*}


# TODO: Make a note on solving linear recursion relations like this
We can find an exact expression of the form

\[
\Delta(t) = \left( 1 - \frac{2}{N} \right)^t \Delta(0)
\]

For \( N \gg 1 \) we see that the time scale of diffusion is set by \( N/2 \) since

\[
\Delta(t) \sim e^{-2t/N} \Delta(0)
\]

# TODO: Do the same calculation for the continuous case
This dependence of the time scale on \( N \) is a result of the fact that we move one particle per
time step at most. If we consider a [[id:20e6a772-314a-49bf-9714-3a7af9c65cf5][Continuous Markov chain]], we will not find this result.

# TODO: Work out the multiple urn Ehrenfest model
This requires the Ehrenfest model with multiple urns.

# TODO: Can we apply renormalization to the continuous Ehrenfest model?
