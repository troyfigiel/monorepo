* What is a confounder?
A confounder is a variable that influences both the [[id:dd1cf8d6-3c14-4188-a158-27edb88235ce][Dependent variable]] and the [[id:883ce7c1-a74e-4993-9f9d-78674d99411b][Independent
variable]]. The existence of confounders makes the phrase [[id:511eb98f-ef12-4cf5-b3f2-6d7cbffea3ad][Correlation does not imply causation]]
quantitative. To calculate the effect of confounders, we use [[id:45613f3d-8a6c-45ba-a984-da7a5b50c91a][Do-calculus]].

* Confounders and predictions
Confounders play a large role in statistics since we will only be able to observe correlation
directly. However, [[id:c8f6e7af-a474-42fe-8cf2-f5b9b178fd3d][Confounders do not impact predictions in a single dataset]] making them less of a direct
problem. Nonetheless, [[id:f6dc032c-ea54-4642-920b-824702242ccf][Confounders lead to poorly generalizable models]].
