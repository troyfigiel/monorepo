#+title: Linear least squares

Linear least squares is a form of [[id:ded30554-7495-4218-9314-6145de6aa926][Linear regression]] with a loss function that loosely takes the form of the
squares of residuals.

There are several different implementations of linear least squares regression, valid for different scenarios

- [[id:0344e85d-6556-4b38-a0b9-a2ccad6e6938][ordinary least squares]]
- [[id:70f1fc2e-a475-47e9-99c2-053a6d8ea373][weighted least squares]]
- [[id:045d80b4-addc-4912-8cd0-35002c10d925][generalized least squares]]

# TODO: Make into a separate note
This regression has a closed-form solution.

# TODO: Does the linear least squares always have an exact solution?
