#+title: Markov's inequality

Markov's inequality states that for a non-negative random variable \( X \),

\[
\mathbb{P}(X \geq a) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{a}
\]

This inequality appears in a number of appendixs:
- [[id:89ef3b96-7b5a-4f92-9249-8a771ca47951][Markov's inequality can be used to prove Chebyshev's inequality]]
- [[id:670571b1-3b59-426d-a5a9-b59f843b6ed5][appendix of generic Chernoff bound from Markov's inequality]]
