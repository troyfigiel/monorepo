[[id:472f36ad-4e07-44d8-b0b6-8cf93ac9e7ae][Information content]] \( I(p) \) should satisfy the following properties:

1. \( I(p) \) is monotonically decreasing in \( p \). The higher the probability of an event
   occurring, the lower its information content.
2. \( I(p) \geq 0 \). Information content is a non-negative quantity.
3. \( I(1) = 0 \). Events that always occur should carry no information content.
4. \( I(p_1 p_2) = I(p_1) + I(p_2) \). Information learned from independent events should be additive.

This leads to the unique value

\[
I(p) = - \log(p)
\]

# TODO: This is easy to prove with differential equations, but we do not require differentiability.

Indeed, let \( f(p_1, p_2) = I(p_1, p_2) \). Then

\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial p_1 \partial p_2} = I^{\prime} (p_1 p_2) + p_1 p_2 I^{\prime
\prime}(p_1 p_2)
\]

On the other hand, \( I(p_1 p_2) = I(p_1) + I(p_2) \) so that

\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial p_1 \partial p_2} = 0
\]

Setting \( u = p_1 p_2 \), we obtain the differential equation

\[
I^{\prime}(u) + u I^{\prime \prime}(u) = 0
\]

which using \( I(1) = 0 \) is uniquely solved by

\[
I(u) = -k \log u
\]

for \( k > 0 \). The value of \( k \) determines the base of the logarithm.
