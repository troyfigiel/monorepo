#+title: GNU store
#+filetags: :stub:

Named the GNU store after the location it stores its builds `/gnu/store`. It is an example of [[id:dd646073-93ac-436c-bd9d-3b343ee41d8b][Content-addressable storage]].

Packages are built all separately in the GNU store and after that, [[id:cffe690c-8a58-43fc-8ce6-8ac777a3acb1][GNU Guix]] simply points to the
files in the store. This cannot break the operating system or home environment, because every
result of a package build has a hash prefix. Any change will create a new hash.

This also allows for example installing different versions of the same package.

Note also that [[id:17d95c6d-6b6d-4326-81d7-e3c1f72a7ca6][Files in the GNU store can only be changed by the Guix build daemon]].
