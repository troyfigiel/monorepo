It makes sense to use a default project template, because what is unique about a data science
project is the data used and the models built. The steps are often the same, i.e. running pipelines
to transform data and then apply a model. This makes a tool like [[id:6fc3864e-2008-46f1-96cf-6619e5c183b7][Cookiecutter Data Science]]
particularly useful.
