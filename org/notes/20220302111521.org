#+title: High multicollinearity can not always be observed from pairwise correlation
#+filetags: :stub:

This is the idea that a set of variables can be linearly dependent, but no pair of them is linearly
dependent. Each pair can have moderate to small correlation while still being perfectly
multicollinear for example.
