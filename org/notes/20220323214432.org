#+title: Elementary cellular automaton
#+filetags: :stub:

An elementary cellular automaton is an example of a one-dimensional [[id:06e9722a-18eb-421d-b35b-c85ad1e56461][Cellular automaton]] with two
conditions:

1. Each cell can only be in the state 0 or the state 1
2. The state of the next generation of a cell only depends on its current state and that of its
   immediate neighbours.

Elementary cellular automata are usually named and classified using the [[id:dfa84d73-0fae-456d-bd21-fd76741bddf4][Wolfram code]].

Although the rules of these automata are very simple, they can still give rise to extremely complex
behaviour. For example, it is known that [[id:1433eba4-e237-485f-bca1-f7950be45310][Rule 110 is Turing complete]].
