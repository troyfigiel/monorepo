#+title: Paired t-test

The paired t-test is an example of a t-test where we compare to samples by pairing each observation
in another sample based on a second variable. For example, day on which they were measured.

If there is a true difference between the pairs, the [[id:2981dd20-424a-4e9e-a0ce-8517ae6c8986][paired t-test is more powerful than unpaired
t-test]]. However, this only works if we have a natural pairing in our data.

Pairing is an example of the more general notion of [[id:e55f27d4-b229-486b-b67f-a9cc11bcda42][blocking]].
