#+title: The training and test sets must be properly randomized
#+filetags: :stub:

When doing a [[id:9dcf3a17-31fd-44f5-b886-34424a1df9fd][Train-test split]], the train and test sets must be correctly randomized. If the
randomization technique in some way depends on the data itself, it is likely that a model picks up
features it should not know about.
