#+title: The structure of my notes is modeled after the Zettelkasten principle
#+filetags: :stub:

The structure of my notes is reminiscent of the [[id:8614fbe4-c508-4dfd-bdfa-f9c8d939b1ba][Zettelkasten]] principle. because is do believe that
[[id:6883747f-8fb0-45b6-90bc-fed0678c1c7d][Connecting ideas requires a different form of note taking from communicating ideas]].

However, I also believe that [[id:e8c99d9c-1302-4bc3-82ac-6a7e2e2bc843][Notes should develop organically]] and that the Zettelkasten terminology
has a more restrictive meaning that I would like.
