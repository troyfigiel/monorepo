#+title: Jensen's inequality

Loosely speaking Jensen's inequality generalizes the idea that a line intersecting a convex function always lies above the the graph of the function.

It has various forms.

In probability theory, it is stated as \( \varphi \left( \mathbb{E}[X] \right) \leq \mathbb{E}\left[ \varphi(X) \right] \) for a convex function \( \varphi \).

* TODO
- It is important in statistical physics because we have \( e^{\mathbb{E}[X]} \leq \mathbb{E} \left[ e^X \right] \). What does this imply?
- Add the finite form which proves the AM-GM inequality. In particular, this follows from the fact that logarithm is concave.
