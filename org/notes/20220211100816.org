#+title: Student's t-distribution

The Student's t-distribution is a family of probability distributions characterized by a single parameter \( \nu \) known as the degrees of freedom.

Since the [[id:d9a653dd-4a7d-421a-82e6-b79018fc744b][mean of normally distributed samples follows the t-distribution]], the t-distribution is the basis of the [[id:bfad7134-ea06-4636-8782-b42695648dc0][Student's t-test]].
