#+title: Guix Home
#+filetags: :stub:

A user's home environment normally consists of three parts:
- Software
- Configuration
- State

In other Linux distros, configuration is a form of global state, which makes it unreliable, because [[id:79c2df6b-f704-40b0-949e-715c90b4e608][Global state is evil]].

Because [[id:17d95c6d-6b6d-4326-81d7-e3c1f72a7ca6][Files in the GNU store can only be changed by the Guix build daemon]] we cannot change the
generated configurations by Guix Home directly. We can remove a symlink manually and create our own
config file, but then if we call the home activation script again, all of this manual configuration will
be backed-up and the symlinks restored.
