#+title: ordinary least squares

Ordinary least squares is a linear regression model \( y_i = \mathbf{x}_i^{\intercal} \mathbf{\beta}+ \epsilon_i \) where we aim to optimize the loss function

\[
S(\beta) = \left\Vert \mathbf{y} - \mathrm{X} \mathbf{\beta} \right\Vert
\]

It is well-known that [[id:5c27ab43-37d4-4baa-b08a-6fb22cab5a29][OLS optimization is convex]]. When \( X \) is full-rank, it is even strictly convex implying that the [[id:d58d3a76-39e4-484a-ad65-bbcd37dc7bd2][OLS optimization has a unique solution]].

Additionally, [[id:fdb455fe-357b-4e7f-8cc4-ea22ab14cfce][The OLS estimator is the maximum likelihood estimate for normally distributed errors]].

Goodness-of-fit is commonly measured with the [[id:9048c6ad-ed34-4eaa-a818-c161c7317e7f][coefficient of determination]] denoted by \( R^2 \).
