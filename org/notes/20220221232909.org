#+title: Git is not intended for large files
#+filetags: :stub:

For larger files, Git stores the entire history and every change to the file as a new file. This is
due to its contant-addressable nature.

Instead, in these cases other tools like [[id:37605e84-f730-4469-8b73-25f8b8710754][Git LFS]] or [[id:ee069ad2-bcf1-4dec-bce4-295bc81e74c7][dvc]] can be used.
