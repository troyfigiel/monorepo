Cross-validation is an example of a [[id:5a1123d6-3be3-47e9-8f1b-fa97eed29d95][Model validation technique]].

A k-fold cross-validation means we split our data into k equally large sets. We can now build k
[[id:9dcf3a17-31fd-44f5-b886-34424a1df9fd][Train-test splits]] by picking one fold to be our test data and the rest to be our training data for
a specific model. Parameter tuning is part of the algorithm.

A more advanced approach is [[id:0e9eff3e-d792-433f-a140-ce8167dcdf37][Nested cross-validation]]
