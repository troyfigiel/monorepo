#+title: Index notes are more flexible than tags
#+filetags: :stub:

Tags are a single word and no other context. In an index note, it is still possible to add
additional context depending on the subject at hand. This makes index notes in general preferable
over tags when it comes to classifying notes. Nonetheless, [[id:a1343f52-4c34-4b98-a487-f3cb85f26436][Tags are useful for metadata]].
