- [[id:8e845680-740d-4f7c-97fd-f4385dda9bf9][Self-documenting code]]
- [[id:7c3b7542-2575-4cb4-b2b0-9f4db87a03cb][Type system]]

also has an advantage on machine-level, because [[id:418139b5-734f-4b48-9c66-97376ffec66f][Types help machines infer programming intent]] and
can in turn help developers, easing the mental burden even further.
