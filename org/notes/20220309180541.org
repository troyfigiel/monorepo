#+title: Global state is evil
#+filetags: :stub:

- Anything can change it, so you can never be completely sure it will behave as expected, unless
  you know everything about what can possibly change the state.
- If you have to change global state, it will have to be changed everywhere it is used. There is no
  [[id:6544a12a-f814-48ba-a692-b3c67a716055][Encapsulation]] and no API used to access the state.
- With global state, many [[id:fa9e775f-96c5-47d7-b2aa-b5096e313c27][Pure functions]] become impure. This means it becomes hard for the compiler
  to optimize these functions.
