#+title: Data transformations naturally form a pipeline
#+filetags: :stub:

When we are transforming data, we often have a fixed dataset and have to apply several functions to
this dataset. An example flow could be

   1. Remove any outliers
   2. Standardize the data
   3. Create new features

Each step works on the output of the previous step, hence forming a pipeline structure.
