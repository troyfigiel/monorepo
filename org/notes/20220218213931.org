#+title: Stirling's approximation

Stirling's approximation is an approximation for factorials of the form

\[
n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n
\]

Sometimes it is also written as

\[
\log n! \sim n \log n - n
\]

# TODO: Often we need to approximate binomials with the Stirling approximation. Maybe separate note?
