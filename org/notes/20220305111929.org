#+title: Black box models lead to serious societal harm
#+filetags: :stub:

It is not uncommon that decisions are based purely on a number. In her 2021 Nobel conference
lecture, Cynthia Rudin mentions the case of a miscalculated score which caused an inmate to spend
longer in jail than they should have. On top of that, the software behind the calculated score was
proprietary with no way to verify its correctness. See [[id:6d684a08-12b3-43d9-9078-8a0fa6aed717][Proprietary software is unethical]].

The above example also showcases another important trap black box models can fall into: The [[id:f6c5de10-a2a4-41a7-b4fd-089491811725][McNamara fallacy]].

Instead, [[id:652a3994-0fac-4d16-9bcc-7b0433d8f7fc][Interpretable models should be used for high-stake decisions]].

# TODO: Add some examples. Need to look up these examples.
- Sacramento's air pollution. Google used proprietary index that said it was safe to go outside
- COMPAS score, inmate spent longer in jail than necessary
- FDA approved models for detecting intercranial hemmorages not performing well and no one knows why
