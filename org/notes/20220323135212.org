#+title: Avoid premature abstraction

The more components are added to a system, the more complex it becomes. [[id:b897355f-2a9e-471d-9450-c333ace038a9][Abstraction is a powerful
tool to fight increasing complexity]], however, care should be taken that simple things are not made
complex by an abstraction.

This can often happen when a programmer or designer introduces an abstraction in anticipation of a
complexity. Instead, you should [[id:46004645-fc20-4e76-bfd4-55596d405219][Refactor when necessary]], keeping principles such as [[id:1e092046-ad51-49b5-b16d-aa31052aa098][KISS]] and [[id:5e1f8794-0ce1-4737-8ead-c06594925f88][YAGNI]]
in mind.
