#+title: Notebooks and spreadsheets are appropriate in different situations
#+filetags: :stub:

A notebook solution such as [[id:f4ba54fa-652e-4191-8973-1a364e638fbe][Jupyter Notebook]] or [[id:fcf1774f-4e9f-4b0a-9fcb-0057679b74ff][R Notebook]] generally makes it easier to build
reports and work with more complicated machine learning or statistical models compared to a
spreadsheet solution.

However, a spreadsheet solution makes data much more accessible. If data needs to be copied or has
to be accessible to the recipient, a spreadsheet is easier to work with.
