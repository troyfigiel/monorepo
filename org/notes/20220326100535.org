- Just starting is important, because [[id:f141107f-cdc0-4e97-b7a0-cec85fb515d5][Avoid premature abstraction]] and note-taking is especially
  personal. In other words, you will not know what works best until you start. It is also a very
  organic process.
- In the beginning it is important to get as many notes in the system as possible. At this point,
  adding new notes does not make it very difficult to maintain and the additional context that
  making links brings you, makes it easier to anticipate and adapt to future changes.
- Related to just getting started, [[id:a6b836b6-ab4e-49ea-969f-4d05f604b335][Take small steps and reevaluate]].
