Example: [[id:3adb06c7-ddc6-4d62-8328-44781c7fecfe][?Asymptotic series of the gamma function]]

If there is a zero derivative in the interval from \( a \) to \( b \) and the function is concave,
the integral is dominated by the global maximum. The rigourous statement is given through [[id:b86e488e-e661-47d9-ba9d-f8dc140480c3][Watson's lemma]].
