#+title: sum of square numbers

* TODO
What is the intuition behind this result?

* As a corollary
This formula is a special case of [[id:f6d1d579-6cd4-42df-bbe9-7dcf184bd3a2][Faulhaber's formula]].

* Formal statement
For any natural number \( n \), the following equality holds:

\[
1^2 + ... + n^{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

* Proof
We can use induction for this result. It clearly holds for \( n = 1 \).

Now assume it holds for a natural number \( n \), then

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
1^{2} + ... + n^{2} + (n+1)^{2} & = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + (n+1)^{2} \\
& = \frac{(n+1)(n(2n+1) + 6(n+1))}{6} \\
& = \frac{(n+1)(2n^{2} + 7n + 6)}{6} \\
& = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

Hence, the equality holds for \( n + 1 \) and as such for all natural numbers. \( \blacksquare \)
