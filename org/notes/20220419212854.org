* How to build a PC
The components always change, but the patterns / process behind picking the right components does not.

* What am I going to with my computer?
** Some examples
| Hardcore gamer  | More budget to GPU and CPU                                             |
| Content creator | Ease up on GPU and invest in CPU and RAM                               |
| Glorified NAS   | Motherboard with lots of IO and case for drive mounts and power supply |

** Gamers
Ask the question again, but deeper. For example gamers:

| RPG and visually complex games | High resolution display with HDR                    |
| Hardcore competitive shooters  | Premium mouse, high-end keyboard, high refresh rate |

Games will also affect number of CPU cores you should get, because different genres of games tend
to utilize them differently.

A good rule of thumb: At least as many cores as a current gen console. Stream and record, at around
2 or 4 more and a high quality video encoder built in.

** Content creators
As for the content creators, what should you focus on? It depends on what you create:

| Digital artist | Nothing special for GPU, but would need a drawing table                       |
| Musician       | Tons of RAM to load up on to load up on instrument patches and samples        |
| Video editor   | Moderate GPU, a lot of RAM and even more storage. Preferably fast             |
| 3D modeler     | Reasonably fast CPU and GPU for rendering, for example capable of ray-tracing |
| Engineer       | Sacrifice horse power for validated hardware like quadro GPU                  |
| Programmer     | Hefty CPU with lots of threads and lot of RAM to go with it                   |
| Writer         | Maybe only needs a keyboard and a decent display                              |

** NAS and home storage

| Cold storage | Backups, ripped media, game installs  | Speed is less important, higher capacity HDD |
| Warm storage | Document or photo dump                | Balance of capacity and speed                |
| Hot storage  | Footage ingest or network boot device | Higher speed and may need a fast CPU         |
