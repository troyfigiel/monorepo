#+title: Requirements for my system of notes

The two main requirements I have for my notes are the following:
- Finding back notes (possibly from a long time ago) is relatively painless
- It is clear how to connect new notes to my older notes

To fulfills these requirements, I find that it is important to keep what I would call [[id:c26ab86a-7288-46b0-b00a-6816358049b3][Clean notes]]
and remember that [[id:6883747f-8fb0-45b6-90bc-fed0678c1c7d][Connecting ideas requires a different form of note taking from communicating
ideas]].

[[id:8054aa2d-5f90-4ea0-a7c2-f985c424c569][The structure of my notes is modeled after the Zettelkasten principle]] and I have taken significant
inspiration from [[id:02a96a91-d4f3-4ac7-9336-28886c7bc14c][Evergreen note-taking]] throughout many of the concepts I use to write my notes.
