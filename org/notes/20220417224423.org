#+title: ?The envelope curve of equiareal triangles is a hyperbola
#+filetags: :appendix:stub:

Consider right triangles defined by the x-axis, the y-axis and a line defined by the equation \( y = -a x + t \). We have to assume \( a > 0 \) to get a bounded triangle in the quadrant with \( x >
0 \) and \( y > 0 \).

The intersection of the line with the axes is given by

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
x_0 &= \frac{t}{a} \\
y_0 &= t
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

This means that the area of the triangle is given by \( \frac{b^2}{2 a} \).

Let us now consider triangles with area fixed to \( A \). Then we can parametrize the family of
lines by

\[
a = \frac{t^2}{2 A}
\]

This means the family of lines can be parametrized by the function \( F(x, y, t) = 0 \) where

\[
F(x, y, t) = y + \frac{t^2 x}{2 A} - t
\]

The envelope curve can now be found by solving the [[id:d6228b0d-d9ea-40b3-98b4-75bf619a9667][Envelope equation]]:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial F(x, y, t)}{\partial t}
&= \frac{t x}{A} - 1 \\
&= 0
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

Hence \( t = A / x \).

Plugging this result back into the equation \( F(x, y, t) = 0 \) we obtain

\[
y = \frac{A}{2 x}
\]

which is a [[id:be48ffc4-7c97-460b-9a80-c784f9dd0f8d][Hyperbola]].
