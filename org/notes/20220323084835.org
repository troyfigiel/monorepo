#+title: Large deviations theory
#+filetags: :stub:

Whereas the [[id:22637763-04bb-49a6-b3e4-4e700b43eddd][Central limit theorem]] tells us that the probability distribution of the mean approaches
the [[id:d59f2d74-dbe3-46e3-8a5e-9849350d24bc][Normal distribution]] for large sample sizes, large deviations theory concerns itself with giving
a better approximation for the tail behaviour. In other words, it allows us to more accurately
describe \( \mathbb{P}(\bar{X} > x) \).

The main result in large deviations theory, is the rather sharp bound

# TODO: What is the name of this statement?
\[
\mathbb{P}(\bar{X} > x) = e^{-N I(x)}
\]

where \( N \) is the sample size and \( I(x) \) is known as the [[id:e13b3144-955d-4763-9f8c-f785925b003f][Rate function]].
