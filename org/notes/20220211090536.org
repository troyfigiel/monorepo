#+title: Bayes' theorem

Bayes' theorem is used to reverse the dependencies in conditional probabilities. More precisely, if we have events \( A \) and \( B \), the theorem states

\[ \mathrm{Pr}(A | B)\mathrm{Pr}(B) = \mathrm{Pr}(B | A)\mathrm{Pr}(A) \]

The results can be counterintuitive. A standard example is [[id:75ca36f7-58eb-4d77-9a29-9d89874e8742][Bayes' theorem in drug testing]].
