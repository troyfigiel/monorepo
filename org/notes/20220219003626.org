#+title: Logistic function

Because the [[id:041ae89d-f312-4fcc-95d5-c4b9277a0be8][Standard logistic function]] standard logistic function has an image lying between 0 and
1 and is monotonically increasing, it can be seen as the cumulative distribution of the [[id:76de247c-a9ac-4e8b-a31c-e0e30f519ea6][Standard
logistic distribution]].

Similarly, the [[id:f4c1dbf3-0f05-4a68-ba2e-b9f6602789d5][Logistic function]] relates to the [[id:6a7ab0e7-d600-4bcf-9398-ec7ea8f0ea23][Logistic distribution]].

The inverse of the standard logistic function is known as the [[id:e9b783ae-9bdf-418d-a024-499e634d5782][Logit function]] and hence is the
quantile function of the [[id:6a7ab0e7-d600-4bcf-9398-ec7ea8f0ea23][Logistic distribution]].
