#+title: Coefficient of dispersion
#+filetags: :stub:

The coefficient of dispersion is defined as the ratio

\[
D = \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}
\]

and is only defined for \( \mu > 0 \). It is generally used for positive statistics (such as counts
or waiting times) or when the underlying distribution is assumed to be either the [[id:38725721-c78d-40ae-b54a-37b679c574ca][Poisson
distribution]] or the [[id:4b4a04e8-a6f4-47c4-afbd-b501cb1ebb35][Exponential distribution]]. In those cases, we have \( D = 1 \).

# TODO: Which test is used to check D = 1 ?

When \( D > 1 \) we call the distribution over-dispersed whereas a distribution with \( D < 1 \) is
an under-dispersed distribution.

For various calculations, see [[id:b10fb6ba-07f8-418b-8edf-9b262be9d027][?Dispersion]].
