#+title: Chebyshev's inequality

Chebyshev's inequality loosely states that the probability mass of a distribution cannot be too far away from the mean, depending on the standard deviation of the distribution.

More precisely, if \( X \) is a random variable with expectation value \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \), for any real number \( k > 0 \) we have

\[
\mathbb{P} \left(  | X - \mu | \geq k \sigma \right) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}
\]

The bounds are relatively loose in practice and sharper bounds can be obtained if more is known about the distribution. However, [[id:8ca59335-a8bc-4f8b-8236-ea6c133d6079][Chebyshev's inequality gives sharp bounds for arbitrary distributions]].
