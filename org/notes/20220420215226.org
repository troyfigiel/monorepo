\[
f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \left[ 100 (x_{i+1} - x_i^2)^2 + (1 - x_i)^2 \right]
\]

In the 2D case, often the following function is considered:

\[
f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2)^2
\]

The latter has a global minimum at \( (x, y) = (a, a^2) \).

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 2(x - a) + 4bx(x^2 - y) \\
&= 0 \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 2b(y - x^2) \\
&= 0
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

The second equation implies \( y = x^2 \), which we plug into the first equation to find \( x = a \).

If we let \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 100 \), this global minimum lies in a very sharp valley defined by
\( y = x^2 \). Finding the valley is easy, but finding the global minimum is not.
