#+title: The equipartition theorem for quadratic Hamiltonians

[[id:3a82e577-1a6a-4eb8-a1c1-2746dca9480c][Quadratic form]]

If a degree of freedom \( x_n \) appears quadratically, such as for a classical freely moving
particle, rotational kinetic energy or potential energy in a [[id:a7071b80-7c24-407a-a488-5a0dcf048935][Harmonic oscillator]]. In that case,
each degree of freedom contributes a total of \( k_B T / 2 \) to the total energy. In particular,
the total energy is independent of the precise microscopic values of any coefficients appearing in
the [[id:a00e92f2-6cae-4515-bad8-264c6bc9dc55][Hamiltonian]]!

In fact, if we are dealing with a real quadratic form,

\[
H = x^{\intercal} A x = x^{\intercal} S^{\intercal} D S x
\]

where \( D \) is diagonal. In this case, we have

\[
H(y_1, ..., y_n) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n d_i y_i^2
\]

where \( y = Sx \). This means that we can apply the equipartition theorem for each term \( d_i
y_i^2 \), showing that every independent degree of freedom \( y_i \) adds a total of \( k_B T / 2
\) of energy to the total average energy.

However, [[id:a5eef577-746a-471f-a49a-75def4552a86][In general the equipartition theorem depends on microscopic parameters]].
