#+title: UMAP
#+filetags: :unclean:

UMAP has a number of nearest neighbours parameter \( \#NN \), which is arguably the most important parameter
to adjust.

# TODO: We need to extract a lot of details from the UMAP versus t-SNE to here
See [[id:df7f9b97-9596-4838-9dd4-97e51beafad7][UMAP versus t-SNE]] for many more details.

UMAP runs [[id:c0edfb32-a9d8-4d3f-b037-670ad8057b54][Stochastic gradient descent]] to minimize the cost function.

# TODO: Which cost function does UMAP use?
