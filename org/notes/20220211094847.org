#+title: Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

For two vectors \( \bold{u} \) and \( \bold{v} \) in an inner product space, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states

\[ \left| \langle \bold{u}, \bold{v} \rangle \right|^2 \leq \langle \bold{u}, \bold{u} \rangle \cdot \langle \bold{v}, \bold{v} \rangle \]

This inequality has a myriad of consequences such as
- [[id:7b6fb399-b93c-491d-bea7-693701f270ac][triangle inequality follows from Cauchy-Schwary inequality]]
- [[id:8766c96e-3dcb-423e-8375-5de03708ee83][correlation coefficient is bounded by 1]]
