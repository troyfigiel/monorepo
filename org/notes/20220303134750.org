A black box model is a [[id:963f964f-1559-411d-9bcc-886d0e6247f3][Machine learning]] model consisting of a function or formula that is either
too complicated to understand for a human or which is proprietary so that we cannot verify what is
happening under the hood. See also [[id:6d684a08-12b3-43d9-9078-8a0fa6aed717][Proprietary software is unethical]].
