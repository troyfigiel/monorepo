#+title: Data stream
#+filetags: :stub:

A data stream collects data in a continuous fashion.

This does not have the [[id:018bc870-f8e9-408e-a3c5-e048983837ea][Latency]] that [[id:7a6ba049-a1cd-43f0-af52-b915f8540759][Batch processing]] has, so we can deploy models continuously.

# TODO: Why exactly? Explain in more detail
Due to the [[id:9e92a377-8bf5-4be8-9ca0-4ec9e7231164][CAP theorem]], data streaming runs into problems regarding consistency of data.
These problems are alleviated through architectural choices such as through the [[id:ec74a43b-86f4-4b01-8201-e0dade746d90][Lambda architecture]].
