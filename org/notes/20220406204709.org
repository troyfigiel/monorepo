[[id:e624dec4-80fe-41c8-bc7b-225f0199c387][Renormalization]] subsumes many methods in perturbation theory. In dynamical systems it also goes by
the name of the envelope method which was independently discovered.

It uses the [[id:d6228b0d-d9ea-40b3-98b4-75bf619a9667][Envelope equation]] to construct a solution out of an envelope of perturbative solutions.

It was shown by Kunihiro that these methods actually coincide and that the [[id:b4891449-950f-4096-94df-068523f0f90a][Renormalization group
equations]] follow from the envelope equation.
