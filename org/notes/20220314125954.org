#+title: Duality between code and data
#+filetags: :stub:

What is meant with the duality of code and data, is that there is no clear separation between what
is considered code and what is considered data. Ultimately, for a computer there are only bits and
the ideas of code and data as separate entities are an [[id:cbdb8404-b5bd-48f4-af8d-b086cca638ea][Emergent phenomenon]].

The phrases [[id:e957d803-586b-43fe-b55f-63ef7eb507d7][Code as data]] and [[id:a6b5bd3f-0853-4b8c-a264-b98313c88f57][Data as code]] refer to unidirectional instances of this duality. However,
sometimes such a distinct separation is not appropriate.

Examples:
- [[id:0f8f1193-72fb-488b-a2e5-1fa48a2a4309][First-class functions]] (because a function is both a piece of code executing a series of steps as
  well as data that can be passed around as an entity)
