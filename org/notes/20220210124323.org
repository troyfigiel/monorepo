#+title: Survival function

If the random variable for a one-dimensional probability distribution is interpreted as a time, the
survival function \( S(t) = \mathrm{Pr}(T > t) \) can be interpreted as the probability of
surviving past a certain time.

The survival function is the complement of the [[id:2863a482-4a08-4b7e-b5ce-4ba4fedfcd78][Cumulative distribution]] and hence is monotonically
decreasing.

It can be defined as

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
S_X(x) &= \int\limits_{x}^{\infty} f_X(u) \mathrm{d}u \\
S_X(x) &= \sum\limits_{u > x} \mathbb{P}(X = u) \\
\end{align}
\end{equation*}

for continuous and discrete data respectively.

Some examples can be found in [[id:3f1133fb-75f2-42d8-8639-304caa4842f4][!Survival function]].
