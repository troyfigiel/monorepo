#+title: Training a model means to learn a function
#+filetags: :stub:

When we train a model, we are doing nothing more and nothing less than building (a possibly highly
complicated) function which takes data of a pre-determined form and and gives back a
prediction. This implies that after training, the function should be considered as fixed until
retraining happens.

This has several subtle, but very important implications. For example
- [[id:07143b01-a696-4052-a302-0a33b11ef771][Normalization should be done only on the training set]]
- [[id:ca48b792-78e1-4732-bd52-b7b993fb7f6a][Choices for variables to eliminate should be made using the training set]]
