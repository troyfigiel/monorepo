#+title: All abstractions are leaky
#+filetags: :stub:

This does not mean abstractions are useless. It simply means that abstractions are not infallible.
An abstraction can work fine in a majority of cases, but break down in more specialized
circumstances.

For example, [[id:1c0ae085-f15d-4274-8977-81959107a515][SQL]] is a layer of abstraction on top of databases, but a database engineer will still
need to know exactly what the query is going to do to perform optimizations.
