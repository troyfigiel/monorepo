#+title: Coarse-graining
#+filetags: :stub:

There are many different forms of coarse-graining, for example

- [[id:e56cc269-d16f-4be3-a796-02edcb33501e][Downsampling]]
- Majority vote
- Fourier-space (Like for a [[id:6315b5b4-fba3-41c1-9d98-3cab2075d4b7][JPEG compression]])

# TODO: Which one exactly?
One of the [[id:b41182e7-9ade-4537-9e65-38e9f94ad46f][Fundamental properties of information]] is a coarse-graining requirement.

Sum of coarse-grained system plus a weighted sum over the microsystems that have been
coarse-grained out.

This shows that coarse-graining always decreases the entropy.
