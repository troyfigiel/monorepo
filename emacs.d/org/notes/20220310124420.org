#+title: Data science process
#+filetags: :stub:

The data science process broadly consists of five steps:
- Selection
- Preprocessing
- Transformation
- Analysis and modeling
- Interpretation and evaluation

This is of course not so strict. At any point you might discover that you need to redo a
transformation or clean the data even further, etc. In other words, data science is an iterative process.

Two well-known processes are the KDD (1996) and CCC (2012) processes. Also important: CRISP-DM (2000).
