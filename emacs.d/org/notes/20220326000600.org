[[id:6e6b1431-ad32-4dcb-96d5-e20bce1748cc][Thermodynamic equilibrium]] is transitive, hence defining it as an [[id:ade00633-2bfc-4ba9-8207-47487fa6ac11][Equivalence relation]]. If system A
is in equilibrium with B and B in equilibrium with C, then A is in equilibrium with C.

In other words, there is only one kind of temperature.
