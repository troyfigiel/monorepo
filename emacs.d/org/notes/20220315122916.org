#+title: An operating system is the result of a function
#+filetags: :stub:

This function takes the configuration and the package tree and builds an operating system. This is
used for [[id:9b5a1b59-91a2-405f-95b3-14643fc6a545][Declarative operating system configuration]].

When global state is involved though, this function is not a [[id:fa9e775f-96c5-47d7-b2aa-b5096e313c27][Pure function]] (see [[id:79c2df6b-f704-40b0-949e-715c90b4e608][Global state is evil]]).
