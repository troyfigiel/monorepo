Duality relationship between points and lines. How?

Related to [[id:850ae262-155c-457c-89b5-1b29d2e3187e][Integration by parts]].

The Legrende transform of the [[id:796ad554-980f-4bd5-99fe-c9b8bdae3ce8][Cumulant generating function]] is the [[id:e13b3144-955d-4763-9f8c-f785925b003f][Rate function]], which is used in [[id:29e64b50-1ad0-40ea-bd7f-c093bb27449e][Large deviations theory]].

Two differentiable functions \( f \) and \( g \) are Legendre transforms of each other if

\[
g' = (f')^{-1}
\]

In other words, the derivatives are inverse functions of each other. The transformation is an involution.
