#+title: Uniqueness of asymptotic series
#+filetags: :stub:

One function can be expanded in terms of many different asymptotic series. However, once we fix an
asymptotic series, the coefficients are unique.

This follows from a simple calculation and the [[id:8a6701f1-38e6-418f-bdee-da2dcf320ce6][?Uniqueness of limits]]:

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x) - \sum\limits_{j=1}^n a_j \phi_j(x)}{\phi_{n+1}(x)} = a_{n+1}
\]

A "natural choice" of choice of asymptotic series is in powers (like a [[id:1d16764b-13d8-4974-8755-5d020e845261][Taylor series]]). When we are
using Taylor series to approximate things, we are using their asymptotic character more than their
convergent character.
