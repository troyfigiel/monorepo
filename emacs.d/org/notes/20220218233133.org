#+title: Feature engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data that can be used to improve the quality of models.

When the number of features grows too much, techniques like [[id:c757d51c-43ad-43b9-93fe-3b165beb810e][Regularization]] and [[id:53cedf46-8bbf-4221-8364-d040a9fa94f6][Feature selection]] can be used.

Building features often means creating numerical features that can be used for classification or
prediction. See [[id:2cebd9a9-0048-4d69-892b-6ebfe1f2f670][Feature vector]]. Anything can be interpreted as a vector.
