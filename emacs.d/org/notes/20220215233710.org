#+title: skewness

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution about its mean.

Although skewness sometimes refers to [[id:ea941b68-950b-463d-b659-9ac7833a7fc7][nonparametric skew]], the standard definition uses the third standardized moment, defined as

\[
\tilde{\mu}_3 = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^3 \right]
\]
