A user on a Linux system is anyone who uses the computer. [[id:5fc0081a-b490-48c2-a314-ad7aaacdfd08][Linux is a multi user OS]].

The [[id:a83c0ecc-947b-4e60-8bc5-0af7c5f67f0c][Superuser]] has full access to the operating system. This is intended for administration
purposes.

Current users can normally be found under `/etc/passwd`.

Users always belong to at least one [[id:6fb57ed9-3f7d-456c-8704-9662cc19fb8e][User group]]. When the user is created, a [[id:c9ca8c00-67fb-4a0c-877e-a64614e8851d][Primary user group]] is
automatically created and the user can belong to several other groups ([[id:862f62c9-2ddf-4176-86c4-aecfb358f355][Secondary user group]]).
