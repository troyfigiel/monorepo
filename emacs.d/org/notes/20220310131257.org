#+title: Machine learning is pattern recognition
#+filetags: :stub:

Machine learning is pattern recognition. We give the computer numerous examples and aim for it to
pick up on the pattern hidden inside the data.

This also means the data does not have to be perfect. It could be that there are some mislabeled
datapoints, but the computer can still pick up on the underlying pattern.

# TODO: Relates to overfitting and underfitting (capturing too much noise into the pattern
# vs. capturing too little of the pattern)
