# TODO: Extend relations with Bernoulli numbers

* Relations
Faulhaber's formula is a formula for the sum of powers of natural numbers. The formula is closely
related to the [[id:f5683ec8-1982-4357-845a-e007091c738f][Riemann zeta function]].

* Formal statement
Let us denote

\[
S_p(n) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^p
\]

for natural numbers \( n \) and \( p \).

The sums \( S_{p}(n) \) can be obtained as

\[
S_{p}(n) = \frac{1}{p+1} \sum\limits_{j=0}^p \binom{p+1}{j}B_jn^{p+1-j}
\]

where \( B_j \) are known as the [[id:ad99ecdd-c9cf-465b-ae5b-9801a9293a31][Bernoulli numbers]].

* Proof
