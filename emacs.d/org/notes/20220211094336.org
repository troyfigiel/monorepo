#+title: maximum a posteriori estimate

The maximum a posteriori probability estimate (MAP) is an estimate of an unobserved quantity based on empirical data. It is equal to the mode of the posterior distribution.

It is closely relation to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), because the [[id:86565f08-6c53-44b0-a2f8-eefb7cc36f55][MAP with uniform prior coincides with the MLE]].
