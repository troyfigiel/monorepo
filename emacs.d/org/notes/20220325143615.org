#+title: ?The discs in the plane do not shatter all sets of four points on the unit circle
#+filetags: :appendix:stub:

Consider

\[
A = \{ (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1) \}
\]

Now two opposite points can never be separated by a disc without also containing at least one other
point. Therefore, the set of discs does not shatter the set of these four points.
