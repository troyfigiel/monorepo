#+title: Preventing data leakage requires discipline

It is easy to fall into the trap of using some forms of information that the test set provides in
your model training. When you need to build a model to predict an outcome, [[id:f1111b2c-8f2a-47fd-a0c0-446e0089f8e7][Create a train-test
split before any preprocessing, normalization or training]].

It is also important to remember that [[id:5bd91f81-9672-44b9-a0f2-b27ccebedf6c][Training a model means to learn a function]]: Data goes in, a
prediction comes out. In particular, this means that after training the learned function should be
considered fixed.
