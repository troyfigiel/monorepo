#+title: Using renormalization to derive the CLT
#+filetags: :stub:

Let a sequence \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \) of indepdent and identically distributed random variables
be given with variance \( \sigma^2 \).

Consider the random variables as (discrete or continuous) spins associated to point on a
one-dimensional lattice \( \mathbb{Z} \).

Now we look at the transformation which zooms out by pairing variables as

\[
X^{(n+1)}_{i/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( X^{(n)}_{i-1} + X^{(n)}_i \right)
\]

for \( i \) any positive even integer and \( X^{(0)}_i = X_i \).

This means that the characteristic function of each random variable at the level \( n + 1 \) can
be described as

\[
\varphi_{n+1}(t) = \varphi_n \left( \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2
\]

Now for a fixed point, we have

\[
\varphi(t) = \varphi \left( \frac{t}{2^{k/2}} \right)^{2^k}
\]

for any \( k = 1, 2, ... \). In particular, if we let \( k \) become large, we find

\[
\varphi \left( \frac{t}{2^{k/2}} \right)^{2^k} = \left[ 1 - \frac{t^2}{2^{k+1}} + ... \right]^{2^k}
\rightarrow e^{-t^2/2}
\]

This appendix is very similar to [[id:b9860804-ad2f-42e9-88f4-fdbee6f263bb][?Proof of the CLT using characteristic functions]]. We basically keep
on pairing variables together. This is a different point of view on essentially the same appendix.
