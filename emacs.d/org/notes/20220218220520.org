#+title: Law of large numbers
#+filetags: :stub:

There are two different versions of the law of large numbers called the [[id:4d7d004b-de90-41c5-baea-4b35cae63326][Weak law of large numbers]] and the [[id:bcf1f800-2c3a-4b30-87a3-e3fa92b42cd2][Strong law of large numbers]].

The law of large numbers states that the sample average approaches the mean of the distribution
when the number of samples approaches infinity.
