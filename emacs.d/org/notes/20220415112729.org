#+title: Bertrand's theorem
#+filetags: :stub:

Betrand's theorem states that there are only two central-force, scalar potentials such that all of
its bound orbits are closed orbits.

These two types of potentials either derive from the inverse-square central force with \( V(r) = -k
/ r \) or from the
radial [[id:a7071b80-7c24-407a-a488-5a0dcf048935][Harmonic oscillator]] with \( V(r) = k r^2 / 2 \).
