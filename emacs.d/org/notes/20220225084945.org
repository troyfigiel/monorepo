#+title: Confounders lead to poorly generalizable models
#+filetags: :stub:

If we are running the model in production or if we apply the model on a different dataset
confounders can have a bigger impact when the relationship between the confounding variable the
other variables changes.

* TODO
- Add more detail
- Give an example where we have a good model on a single dataset, but it does not generalize well
  - Maybe Titanic dataset where we find a confounding relation for men but not women or vice versa?
