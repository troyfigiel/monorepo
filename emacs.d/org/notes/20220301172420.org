#+title: When other tests can be applied, the sign test is often the least powerful
#+filetags: :stub:

Normally, when the [[id:83cb1207-c9c3-4b04-938e-16f9bd0a9771][Paired t-test]] or the [[id:c026e04f-cb72-468b-ab43-af24eb5f6c12][Wilcoxon signed-rank test]] are applicable, they are often
more powerful than the sign test.
