#+title: Convergent system
#+filetags: :stub:

Once [[id:364c4a7f-6a3f-4d80-92cb-a8ca5b8409bf][Configuration drift]] has been observed, a system for which state has diverged from expectations
will be made into a convergent system, i.e. a system where the state changes over time in such a
way as to close the gap between reality and expectations of administrators.

This is usually done through tools like:
- [[id:f7ad75d2-cb09-4a82-b556-2eca7cbe950f][Puppet]]
- [[id:2b8ee7a6-a7d8-4e6d-8244-c441c8e98780][Chef]]
- [[id:837b8f7d-221e-440e-80c1-ff96bd095f7c][Ansible]]
