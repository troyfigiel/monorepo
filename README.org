* Git cloning repositories to specified directories
Problem: Once they are cloned, they are read only and fixed to a certain commit.

I will need to use home.nix to already download the python and terraform versions I need.
I also need to set up the direnv plugin and download a version of direnv.

* Deploying the config files in ~/.config
