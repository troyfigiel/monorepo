* Troy's reproducible builds

** Disclaimer, be aware!

This is very much a work in progress and (currently) is only intended to be used by me. Although I am cleaning up code along the way and I am aiming to turn the code here into a presentable format, if something works, it is good enough for me at this stage.

Since the lack of Nix examples has been a major stumbling block for me initially, I hope this can pose as an example of what a functioning Nix setup could look like. Some useful references I have been using often (in no particular order):
- https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles
- https://gitlab.com/NickCao/flakes
- https://github.com/misterio77/nix-config (see also https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs)
- https://github.com/Mic92/dotfiles

** TODOs

Since I am working on this project by myself, I am using TODO.org to organize some of my thoughts and possible future directions for my reproducible builds.
