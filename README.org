* Git cloning repositories to specified directories
Problem: Once they are cloned, they are read only and fixed to a certain commit.

* Installing Python and Terraform versions with asdf
Problem: Once again, after setting up, .asdf becomes read only.
I will need to use home.nix to already download the python and terraform versions I need.
I also need to set up the direnv plugin and download a version of direnv.

* Deploying the config files in ~/.config
Create a Docker config?

* Automatically setting up Syncthing
I can check the syncthing.nix file for some options here.

There is a system service that works well for the set-up.
Not sure about the home-manager service.

* Setting up Signal desktop
Available as a home-manager service?
